Managers completely detached from reality.\n\nAggressive senior member of staff using obscene language at daily stand up to describe other staff members and teams.\n\nManager behaving in misogynistic fashion making inappropriate comments to female members of staff and ignoring toxic behaviour within the team.\n\nPassive aggressive HR department \"We use a Bradford scoring system, so don't ever get sick\". Bombarding everyone with pointless, endless mandatory training courses.\n\nAncient tech stack, rotten code base, irrational resistance to refactoring, changing or upgrading existing code." .
