International Business Machines Corporation


International Business Machines Corporation (commonly referred to as IBM) is an American multinational technology and consulting corporation, with headquarters in Armonk, New York. IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and offers infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology.[3]

The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) through a merger of the Tabulating Machine Company, the International Time Recording Company, and the Computing Scale Company.[4][5] CTR was changed to ""International Business Machines"" in 1924, using a name which had originated with CTR's Canadian subsidiary. The initialism IBM followed. Securities analysts nicknamed the company Big Blue for its size and common use of the color in products, packaging, and logo.[6]",no cons no cons no cons

Relatively good job security unless you are in the hardware / storage side of the business..,"Even with multiple years in a row of '1' PBC performances, salary raises are incredibly limited. Typically 1-2% a year would be 'great' year. This is coming from someone who put in 50-60 hours a week. Teams and entire groups make it extremely difficult to move laterally within the company because they have such a hard time back filling positions (getting open reqs).

Get used to having a used (old) laptop and then having to hold on to it for 4 years before an upgrade. Basically ""BYOD"" is mandatory if you care about your equipment. The security / process is ridiculous.. easily spend 20% of your time just doing that stuff.

There are too many people who were acquired and have great salaries.. there is just no incentive for them to work hard. For example, in the same job role, there could be one guy making $150k, and another making $75k for the same job. The guy at $150k has no incentive to work hard because they are capped at their band level and are unlikely to make more money. The other guy at $75k also has no incentive to work hard because even if they are an all-star, they will get maybe a 1% raise if they are lucky.

I can't even count the number of people that work remote that just stay in ""meeting mode"" all day. You know perfectly well they are just making themselves look busy.. ridiculous. Get them back into the office and productivity would likely crease 2x."

Management Bias
A LOT of constant pressure and being fired is always a constant menace.
Database is the ONLY product with good sales. 

Oracle is a great company, I did love the pressure they placed on myself, because they forced me to become more efficient and to worry a lot about my prospection process and who I wanted to be and do. 

The big problem with Oracle are 2 things, management and HR. Manager will pretty much step on you every single time they have a chance, and to be honest to my reader mine WASN'T like this, yet as soon as he switched to another company i started seeing outside the bubble he had created for us. It is often to see people worried or crying about getting fired, because for Oracle if you ain't doing your quota you are not worth their time, and you'll be on the street by the end of the Q. 

Does this sound too extreme? Well..that's the true way it is. 
So why do you stand up to this? The payment is good. 
Why is HR another problem? Because there is little investment on the situation of their employees, and before even considering switching you to another manager or product, getting rid of you is a better choice."

Climate research is only looking for reasons why it might be warming, and not why it might be cooling or just merely averaging out on a sinusoidal pattern. Methods of temperature and humidity measurement are now no longer accurate, using electronic sensors and satellite electronic sensors to measure surface temperature (which can never be properly calibrated every 6 months to a year). These instruments are from the lowest bidder and will always drift to the warmer as the sensors get old....funnily enough by 0.5 degrees per decade....exactly the rate of alleged global heating!
Management are just playing at being in control, where as in actual fact, nobody is...hence the resignation of the recent CE and the massive out of control spending of one of his minions....never got into the press about that scandal, but millions were spent on lavish schemes by one individual with self interest in enjoying himself.  Kept very quiet!
Far too much political correctness, unless it is wretched feminism and anti-male sentiment.
There are far too many other Cons to fit in!"

346570,IBM,2012-06-15, IT Specialist,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",,2,2.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,x,x,r,Corporate scrooges and unending work processes make the IBM workplace painful to endure,"Some opportunities to work with interesting customer and projects, good colleagues. Good opportunities to learn (web based training, mostly on your own time).","Company accountants rule everything. Cost cutting is the only rule for everything, irrespective of the cost in productivity, morale, turnover. IBM will no longer even buy a computer monitor for your desk- forcing you to use the tiny 14"" screen on your ""standard issue"" laptop (yes they still make them that small, and no you are not allowed to even pay extra yourself to upgrade it to something reasonable). There is no coffee provided on site-  not even paper/plastic cups provided for water! At one site I visit there are no rubbish bins under the desks, so IBM saves on the cost of cleaners.

The current employee performance rating system is a ""forced distribution system"" which takes global performance in your division, and no matter what your local team's performance mandates to your direct manager a percentage of people in your team who *must* be rated as unsatisfactory (too bad if you did an OK job, just take your turn at being told your 60 hour weeks were ""unsatisfactory""). There is a fixed ""skip"" percentage each quarter who must be paid none of their ""at risk"" pay component (note this is  NOT a bonus, it is supposed to be part of your pay, this is ""skipped"" for the unlucky recipients of an unsatisfactory rating).

Also be prepared to take on IBM's financial risks with a mandatory corporate credit card that is actually your personal liability- so if IBM does not pay your expense claims for some reason, it can affect your personal credit rating.  If you do get the chance to travel, be happy with a ""per diem"" fixed expense reimbursement that has not gone up in 20 years, and might cover continental breakfast in the hotel, but won't stretch to a modest room service dinner in the hotel chosen for you by IBM. No, you'll be out walking the street in the rain searching for a McDonalds.

Longer-term employees are gradually pushed down the salary scales due to rare/nonexistent pay increases (my previous manager told be that if I left he would be able to offer $50K extra to rehire a person of similar experience).

Education is possible, mostly if you do web-based training in your own personal time. You will also be likely forced to go on courses that are of little practical use, in order to meet some mandatory metric of education attendance decreed globally by someone who knows nothing about what you actually need. When you ask for budget to attend a course that is actually of direct use and benefit in your role, it will be near impossible to get budget to attend.

If you are going into sales, prepare to be micro-managed with spreadsheets and sales data to be entered for everything, the number of phone calls you make to be measured as a ""success metric"", and to have to review the same sales opportunities multiple times with different managers (""cadence"" calls). Leaving little time to actually work with clients.

If you choose to work at IBM, recognise that you should be in it for the short term- even though you may get a decent salary on joining to entice you in, you will not get regular pay rises, and the ""on target earnings"" you are promised are unlikely to be achieved, let alone over-achieved. Be prepared to be ""nickel and dimed"" to death, with cost savings gone mad.

Don't treat it as a career and you will be OK- just grin and bear the idiocy of the accounting scrooges, the interminable complex processes, the unfair and randomly distributed poor performance ratings (which IBM can't/won't report on in a job reference anyway), take a few years of OK then substandard pay, then use IBM as a reference and get out and find a place that is fun to work in, where the company values you."

Not too much competition or pressure as they really don't have a strategy or goal","To start with, they live at least 20 years in the past. They have no idea of recent developments in technology. Highly irritating products like Lotus Notes, Symphony and whatnot. IBM tries to ape any product out there which is famous and used e.g. they have their own version of Google Analytics called 'Tea Leaf'. Nothing wrong with copying, but instead of giving a differentiating factor, these products are highly unusable and cost about 10 times more than the original. A bit mad.

A lot of brainwashing. So basically they make products that no one is interested in, force employees to use them because no one else will use them, and then brainwash you into thinking its good just because its IBM made. In addition, you are expected to think greatly of IBM employees just because they are part of IBM (some people here are really really skill-less)

The worst thing I found here is the amount of monthly lay-offs. Anyone on bench even for a short while is laid off. Projects think they do you a favor by employing you from bench even if you are overqualified. Weird.

IBM is a slowly dying organism because of its ancient technology and attitude. It is a bit difficult to be part of this organism and not feel like you are dying with it in your career. I am trying to get out, but dont want to make another rash decision like IBM."

There are incredible outside speakers who come (Obama, Hillary Clinton). You'll probably only be able to see them on video unless you devote hours of your workday to waiting in line to see them in person, but it's still live and pretty darn cool!

I work in Online Sales and Operations, where pretty much everyone gets a weekly one-on-one meeting with their manager. That is one upside to working in the sales organization as opposed to some other areas of the company. Many engineers have limited facetime with their manager.","Total compensation is good, but your base salary will be low. You'll make up for it in bonus and the cost of not having to buy breakfast and lunch. You won't get the bonus if you're on leave (i.e., medical leave, maternity leave, etc) so you'll end up getting a lower slice of your total compensation than you might at some companies that provide a higher base salary. 

There is huge variation among managers in the sales organization. Some have no experience managing people, some have experience but still aren't good managers, and some are great. 

People who think up innovative new ideas are recognized and compensated better than people who do all the work to implement those ideas. Depending on where you are on the ""thinking up crazy new ideas"" scale, you this may be a downside for you.

Expectations aren't clearly set in the online sales organization--you can discuss with your manager ad naseum what the expectations are, what projects to complete, etc. but you can never be assured of a particular reward (performance rating, bonus, promotion) for completing everything you discuss. Basically your manager can't promise you anything. This is un-motivating for me personally; you may or may not be motivated by this structure.

Engineering is king at Google--you may develop an inferiority complex if you are not in engineering. They won't even give the same headphones to non-engineers as they will to engineers. I tried requesting them and was denied!

Online Sales and Operations is not very flexible about work-life stuff, such as telecommuting a couple of days a month, arriving late in the morning, etc. It is fine to do it every now and again if you ask permission from your manager in advance and have a valid reason like an appointment. Engineering offers much more flexibility in this area."

Apple trains its employees how to communicate well with people. Diverse people to work with. Decent discounts, not great! Health insurance is decent. Guaranteed 15min breaks and lunches. They used to work really well with Part-time employee scheduling, but right before I left they were cracking down on wanting employees to work more without added benefits. On launch days, food and drink was provided for staff.","Even though I had a very high percentage of sales in certain areas and they gave me praise I never got promoted. One reason stated by a manager was that I was doing to well in the area that I was in so and they couldn't afford to lose me to another area of the store, ie. Genius. I then asked for a raise and only annual raises are given...A mere .45 cents.  Work almost full-time hours without the full-time pay or benefits. For a company that is the most profitable in the world, you would think they would kick back a bit more for their employees. 

Apple needs to figure out a better way to get the message across to customers on how the store operates. I spent so much time getting yelled at by unsatisfied customers because they didn't know they were suppose to check in or where to purchase an item. They greatly need to increase the staff for the amount of traffic each store receives on a daily basis. This understaffing lead to many unsatisfied customers taking it out on employees which in turn make for a very trying day, which turns into every work day."

Leadership mostly there and unable or unwilling to consider diverse multi-site locations for positions & teams very often if ever any more even though this is a global company with big investment in real estate and IT infrastructure in Texas.  Does everyone really have to sit beside each other today? With our IT capabilities, work from home, telepresence, etc. this seems antiquated.  Trust issues? cheaper in Texas so cost is unlikely.
Impossible to get ahead.  Promotions for your direct reports (we are talking title changes only here) require approval from the Pope and the President practically.  They probably think we just don't want to promote them.  If they only knew! 
No real openings in Texas to move around much in management or otherwise so promoting that way is hard too.  Move to CA? Get ready to pay state tax with your pay bump.  No thanks.  Basically will not be a seriously competitive IT employer in SA for much longer at this rate.  Will have too small of a presence with not enough interesting job offerings."

I met my best friend at Aldi, so for that I'm truly grateful.","Yeah the salary seems fabulous but if you track your hours correctly you'll find you're not being paid right. Basically the Um and Ah for the complaint period (7 days) so you never get it rectified. 
The benefits package??? Don't make me laugh. It's totally useless. Even if it was useful, you'd not get the chance to use it as your entire life is Aldi. The shift patterns are extremely undesirable. When doing the rotas they seem not to consider whether or not you need to sleep and eat. 
Wake up feeling ill??? Don't even think of ringing in as not even death is an excuse as to why you can't make it in to your shift. If you're lucky not to get screamed at for ringing in and you get say three days off sick, don't imagine it'll mean you've had three days off sick. They use the Bradford Factor and you end up with a crazy score at the end. I had four days off (not in a row) and I scored 16!!! It's a system to stop people taking the you know what. Which, of course, is not fair to people who are genuine. If you look the Bradford Factor up you'll see that it is described as short-sighted and unsuccessful. I'm not surprised Aldi chose that system.
I went to Aldi knowing it would be hard. The work is back breaking and there is no let up. It's like you're expected to be in many places at once while a negative atmosphere swirls around you. Instead of training me properly I have spent almost my entire time there being screamed at. Due to said atmosphere, the team structure constantly breaks apart and the jobs given are done half-assed. I mean who wants to work really hard at 6am with a manager stood over you constantly spewing negativity all over you? So I don't blame them but sorting their mistakes always seems to get me in trouble!!
Each manager has their own way of working the shop floor. Sometimes it leaves my head spinning as I just don't know how to do anything without upsetting at least two managers. You have to keep changing the way you do things. That being said, if you're a ""favourite"" you can pretty much do as you please. 
When I say ""favourite"" I am of course referring to the Store Managers ""Click"". If you're not in that click, woe betide you. The you know what will be flung in your direction.
Managers get in trouble for not being negative enough. I even have an idea that they are not allowed to be positive. Anyone that threatens the balance of this 1950s structure is out. Transferred without being asked. So do I want to be promoted? No. 
The money is just not worth it for any level. 
When it comes to your health, sometimes they can be sympathetic, that is until they realise it will mess with their productivity. Work place accident? About six months in I had a serious accident that involved me going to the hospital. On returning to the store I was told I might face disciplinary action. They really don't care about your well being.
Before anyone who reads this review and judges me as a disgruntled employee, I'd like to say I'm not. I am actively seeking employment elsewhere. I am resigned to my current fate. I just want people to know what it is actually like."

Because of the rapid growth, there is a very open dialogue between the Partners, MDs, managers and associates about where the firm/team has been and where it is going.  In a lot of ways, the environment within the advisory group is similar to that of a startup because people are constantly being hired, new clients are always being sought after and signed, and the group is experiencing double digit growth in terms of revenue and headcount. 

The work experience is top notch.  The clients and nature of the work you are exposed to is excellent, and your ability to make an impact on the final product is huge because deal teams are small (3-5 people).  You'll learn a lot if you are proactive enough.","The downside of all the growth happening is that it is easy to fall between the cracks.  You really need to be proactive and look for your own work to be on by politicking with your peers, otherwise you won't get picked up on work.  The general composition of the group is 25 to 30-somethings that are all single and act like they're still in college.  The people in the San Francisco office in particular tend to take themselves too seriously and have a bit of an elitist attitude because the majority of the clients are private equity, and therefore they think that they are somehow working in private equity (they're not).    This is a well-documented fact amongst the group, as you can often hear other surrounding offices and advisory teams mention that they generally don't like to work out of the San Francisco office or with San Francisco-based due diligence folks."

At one time we had some great managers as well but they either left the company or was let go after being purchased by new international company.,"The last year of employment I was one of the first employees to be thrown on a new platform (the company started building back in 2000). Not many resources for help on this new platform, not much direction from management nor clear documentation on how to do certain things that the new clients had been sold. Product was not even close to being completed in order to service the new clients requests. My entire years of employment I never received so much as a warning, a write up and always received a good reviews and raises. I was dismissed for coming in late after working long hours days/nights and weekends. The amount of work expected after being purchased by Sage was not feasible for one person being so short staffed on the production side yet they added 60+ more sales reps at the same time. This was communicated and repeated to upper management many times by many of the coworkers."

Chance to travel and work overseas.  Company is well known, maybe for its legacy systems but it is the 800 lb gorilla.  Working in a 50,000 employee company can be a bit daunting however the converse means plenty of opportunity.  I think it comes down to ""think globally, act locally"" by this I mean it's who your immediate management chain is that will really make or break the work environment.  Maybe this is obvious but this mitigates the fact the company is so large.  The benefits are also extensive and the company takes care of its performers.  A critical view of any company is how they handle the top 10%.  This may seem elitist but if you don't take care of your top 10%, you will find them elsewhere.  SAP understands this.","MRP, ERP and any other 3 letter alphabet soup systems can be like chewing chalk however the amount of sophistication and technology required to get this stuff right add some luster back.  Regarding company size, this can be daunting almost like you need a map.  This makes it difficult to determine the interfaces and moving parts in any strategic effort as there are many stakeholders whos intent has to be gauged and accounted for.  This just means you have to be more astute and organized if you're dealing with senior level work.  I guess this would apply to any large company and SAP being a German company means you must be culturally aware."

On the night shift not much is going on after you have finished your work so you can watch a movie on the side in reception. Managers are not normally around after 6pm so the evening shift is better then the morning and they are never there on the night shifts which can be an added bonus (especially if they are bullies).,"Being asked to cover shifts at the last minute especially by staff that are suddenly leaving, whilst I was there a staff member left every month from a team of receptionists that where only 4 on days and 2 on nights, the entire team refreshed after 6 months. Some hard working and long standing staff members left after they had difficulty getting on to the Aspire course which is Travelodges (training course) and one of only ways to move up the ladder with them. Places are limited and from what I heard whilst being there most people don't get on. I was there for almost a year. 

Wage is minimum and even on promotion it is only £1 more. Managers are paid commission so push staff hard to get their key drivers, some of them are lazy so get ready to cover part of there work. 

If you want to get on the course your manager has to put you forward positively so you will have to cover all the extra shifts and awkward shifts to get on the course, quickest you can get on is after about 8 months so be ready for hard work. If a staff member leaves which is inevitable then get ready to work 50/60 hour weeks at awkward times. Another guy that worked there actually said to me he has no life outside of work as he was studying at the same time. Same as me at the time, I was doing a 50 hour week then. 

Your weekends are not yours, they belong to the company and if your manager changes the times and shifts at the last minute then you have no choice but to except even if you have children, this is not the most parent friendly company.  Some managers won't hire until you say you are available for all shifts.  If your a student say which days you can't work in the interview otherwise they won't let you have them off. 

Some managers are not that experienced, few have degrees themselves, this was the case for me. Managers may act aggressively and can start to shout badly, if they do this then don't leave the company, first complain and then leave if that's what you intend on doing, this is because complaints are not taken seriously if you leave and then complain. If they start to shout and bully you complain on the same day, don't wait, unfortunately this happens and is not taken seriously enough. 

Housekeeping/cleaners have the hardest job as they are paid for each room they clean and told they have to do it in 20 mins. Most cannot keep to the times, on busy days they are given more rooms then aloud. It is supposed to be 10 rooms full clean maximum but they often go to 13 with another 2 as service cleans (half cleans). I don't advise you work here as a housekeeper, join another brand. 

Sometimes staff do not have time to clean time fully due to a lack of staff. Travelodge are incredibly penny pinching, they don't take agency staff at all, hence the erratic shifts when someone takes time off. If you have to work Thursday through to Sunday then get ready for a hectic set of shifts, you are unlikely to have enough housekeepers on, and will have too many rooms to clean from my experience."

- Lots of great people do work for the company.
- As admin, there is opportunity to go out into the field to see the work the ground operatives complete - a great way to get to know how you fit in with the company as a whole and appreciate the work you are organising others to complete.
- Limited but available opportunities to go out and meet clients. You have to push for this depending on the account managers though, and seems to be getting more limited so not sure if this is still the case as it was for me. If you are eager, keep pushing for this experience and escalate as there are managers who are eager to help achieve this.
- Management was receptive to my reasons for leaving and showed they were taken on board.","- Terrible workload management leaving lots of staff with far too much on their plate. Many admin work extra hours to avoid the stress of being behind but this is not addressed as a problem. This also creates toxic atmosphere among colleagues who feel they have the short end of the stick.
- Bad handling of mental health. Affecting multiple staff members very negatively in our office alone.
- No real room for progression even though this is played up when you start at the company. Management know there is not much space for this but advertise it as a perk of the job on hiring anyway."

They have paid new starters more than staff who have been there for years, they used a TUPE loophole to pay us less than new joiners, which isn't fair.  Using a loophole to value you less creates a real sense of dissatisfaction, profit over people. No chance for a real promotion, all promotions are extra work, extra pressure, but no extra pay. You get flex and overtme, but no recognition for your work. Expected to more complicated work, above what you signed up for, on the old TUPE salary, but the TUPE issue in 2018 was conveniently swept under the carpet. Now there is a completely different system, so you can be having IT issues and technical work every day.   You train staff but still on trainee rates yourself after three years and regardless of your background and skills. Working hard is rewarded with extra work but no salary level with non-TUPE staff doing similar tasks. You were told they are looking into making the salaries fair to create a temporary sense of placation - until you give up asking and just leave like everyone else. Undervalue seriously affects your morale and wellbeing - and your sense of job security. Made to feel like you are easily replaceable."

Leadership development opportunities are endless for business leaders - because IBM has very experienced leaders (10-40 years of experience) there is a lot of wisdom, in addition IBM has invested heavily in this space keeping the skill current
Family friendly - good benefits, flexible work schedules
Excellent virtual tools to facilitate global collaboration","Lack of investment in the US - Most of the new talent is being hired abroad, which means tomorrow's future leaders will be in these growth markets (China, India, Russia, Brazil).  

A large portion of US technical talent is wasted on educating cheaper later in the growth markets.  The end result is poor quality products developed by a large number inexperienced developers.  A better quality product could be achieved with a smaller, more experienced team.  There needs to be a finer line established between the people responsible for training and the people responsible for delivering good products.  Almost no one has demonstrated the ability to do both at the same time.

IBM is not as selective as they should be in terms of technical talent.  Instead of hiring the top technical talent selectively, they hire a large number of less talented individuals.  Occasionally this works out ok as people can grow.  However, this often results in poorly designed products that do not meet customer expectations.

It takes too long to fire incompetent engineers due to legal risks.  Thus these engineers drag down product quality and the productivity of teams.  Or, sometimes these individuals hide in the system by moving from one product to the next.  Since it is so hard for managers to get rid of incompetent individuals, the managers resort to transferring them to some other team to become some other manager's problem."

Work is very hard and tiring and places stress on staff over getting a job done. 
Formal complaints are not taken seriously, and managers often excuse bad behaviour by supervisors towards associates.

Last year I was employed by Marks & Spencer to work in their Food Hall & Cafe, and although it's only been a year, there has been so many great memories with plenty more still to come. The staff are extremely lovely, they make you feel welcome, treat you like everyone else on your first day like you've been there for years. You do feel like a M&S family. They're very flexible with what hours you can do, if you have other commitments one week etc. they will get someone to cover you providing you don't do it all the time. And if you're looking for overtime, they're more than likely to have some for you. Money isn't bad either. M&S are a great company to work for, so if you're debating whether to apply or not, give it a go. I'm positive you'll enjoy it.",There isn't really anything bad to say about Marks & Spencer in the time I've worked there.

When you start, you will receive a $500 bonus to be used every 3 years so buy something immediately.  25% off one item from each product family per year - desktop, ipads, iphone, etc.  15% for up to three friends every year.  If you work in IS&T and you love project management, then this is for you.","Every IS&T department team is governed by the onshore and offshore vendor model primarily from India companies.  If you enter as a developer, you will be involuntarily assigned to work as a technical program/project manager role where you will delegate all your code to onshore and offshore developers.  Sometimes you'll get good developers, but most of the time, you'll get mediocre or below-average developers.  There is no diversity in this department as the overall ethnicity is 99.999% India descent.  Most of the senior managers are not technical, not hands-on and rely solely on the  program/project managers/consultants to deliver all projects for them.  The technical knowledge is heavily relied on the consultant/contractor engineers.  The performance reviews can be conducted  arbitrarily and can be tweaked at the discretion of the manager.  It depends on the manager's integrity and honor if he/she will base your performance on merit.  Over time, the more you do project management work, the less you will do technical work unless you put in long hours at night.   The management team will do whatever possible to protect themselves and avoid all risk.  There is a lot of politics and arrogance.  One director hired most of her managers from her previous company.  Everyone who knew the director ascended to management ranks by this association.  So either it is by coincidence or maybe cronyism?  If you don't belong in that ""3com club"", then you will not be as richly compensated.  e.g. The managers brag to their employees about buying and/or rebuilding 1- 3 million dollar homes (ground up) in areas of Saratoga, Cupertino, and Evergreen.   

Just to emphasize, this is for the Apple IS&T department.  All other product development teams - iCloud, iTunes, etc. will not have this environment.  Furthermore, it can be confirmed that those departments are more diverse in ethnicities, rely on badged employees for development work, and work long hours depending on the team and project."

Clock on machine asks you why you are late if you are unfortunate enough to be 1 minute late, but doesn't ask the same if you clock off late because you have been running around like a headless chicken. When I first started I went full of enthusiasm with a genuine want to care for people and I love the job in itself but the company do not value you at all you are just a number to them. Which is a shame as most of the staff slog their guts out here for minimum wage. The training is majorly computer based there really needs to be more hands on training but this wont happen as you have to come in and clock on if you fall behind on the computer based training you get intimidating letters which in turn leads you to try and complete these on days off with no pay unless you go into Work!! The home managers think and talk to you like something they have just stepped in and you feel intimidated to call up if you are sick, some of the nurses the same, in my 4 years of working here there was 5 managers!!! 3 regular and 2 turnaround, the manager that interviewed me was lovely and couldn't say a bad thing about her but sadly only lasted a short time due to what i can only assume was stress as you could see that she was trying to make the home a nice place to live and work. As for the other 4 they either couldn't be bothered with you or constantly trying to make you feel like you were worthless. I was off with a very serious illness in intensive care towards the end of my employment and when I came home, i had a snotty letter through the post to read about the company's absence reporting policy, and again threatened with disciplinary action, even though I had reported my absence at the earliest opportunity (people don't decide when they are ill believe it or not!!!)going back to the minimum wage you work 12 hour shifts and are paid for 11 so you have an hour unpaid ""break"" most of the time you are lucky to get as you are run off your feet if you are understaffed, on with an agency carer who is unfamiliar with the place or alone with just a nurse, then there's the paperwork!! It's a wonder environmental agencies haven't been on their backs as the amount of trees they may have to chop down to satisfy the ridiculous amount of paperwork you have to do is shocking, even though suggestions have been put to the home managers to still have all the required information but in a more streamlined system then more time can be spent on what should matter most, THE RESIDENTS. The staff morale is rock bottom where I used to work and will never pick up whilst staff are constantly being made to feel like they are useless instead of being praised for the fantastic job they are doing, lots of great carers and nurses have left as they cannot cope with the workload and stress. If you still want to work for this company make sure you check you wages very carefully every month as they are frequently wrong and therefore you are very underpaid and they don't usually rush in trying to rectify this for you."

In particular, there is absolutely no strategy to the Consulting by Degrees program, although they are trying to reinvent it now. As it stands now, there is a lot of lip service paid to development and training but nothing is done in those regards.

Management communicates that they do not care about employees, beginning from before they even begin. Many consultants have had their start dates delayed last minute and promotions delayed but then management would claim that they weren't delayed (despite evidence to the contrary). Health care premiums get more expensive every year and professional development events are often held at home offices on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, when most consultants are on the road. There is a lot of lip service paid to employee value and professional development, but nothing more than that.

The performance system, despite being ""reinvented,"" still rates you based on your utilization which, in turn, impacts your raises at promotion. If you join in Q4, you will likely hit the bench for the rest of the year and Q1 of the next, which will keep your utilization rate and, accordingly, your PBC low. In the existing system, it is way too easy to be punished at raise time for joining during a slow business time even if it is not your job to sign work.

For a technology company peddling its advanced cognitive and analytics abilities, IBM does not outfit its consultants with modern technology. It does not look good to clients when we drag out clunky laptops that experience constant operational problems to try and sell them on our technical products. Employees are usually only eligible to upgrade computers and phones every 3-4 years, which is far too infrequent. 

IBM Sales & Delivery are incentivized differently and often butt heads when trying to sell work. Sales often result in impossible projects, with greatly reduced staffing plans and impractical timelines and, in turn, the client is upset when the promises made by Sales cannot be realized. This gap needs to be resolved in order to preserve client relationships.

Although improving in recent months, corporate communications remain abysmal. Strategy is rarely communicated to first line managers before it is announced company-wide, key questions about massive organizational changes are not answered by leadership until months after the fact, and there is no single source of truth for basic administrative questions. There is no reason that five different managers should provide five different codes for vacation time.

Your professional opportunities are very hit or miss. The Consulting by Degrees participants, in particular, are often put on testing or project management assistant roles that last up to a year and provide no room for professional growth. There can be some cool work to do on sales bids but usually that work is not billable (so you will be punished for it come review time) and sales work is not for everyone.

IBM leadership always gives the spiel that you can ""go anywhere you want in the organization,"" given that there is someone willing to take you in the new group and someone willing to let you go in your current group. However, even when these conditions are satisfied, leadership will arbitrarily put ""transfer freezes"" on entire segments of the business for months on end or put down some other red tape. Unfortunately, it is incredibly rare to be able to actually move between groups, even if it is the best move for all parties concerned.

Finally, there are far too many incompetent people that manage to hang on through all of the layoffs. This is due, in large part, to the continuing over reliance on utilization rate to determine an employee's value to the company. An employee can be doing virtually nothing on a project with no capped hours (can bill as many hours as they want) while someone contributes to a $100 million sale with no billable code and their utilization code tanks. By logic, the person who contributed to a large sale is far more valuable than the employee who bills a lot but does nothing. However, in this scenario, the person who contributed to the sale would be laid off before the other. I have encountered far too many Band 8 and 9 consultants who have no people skills, weak management skills and basic gaps in knowledge about Microsoft Excel or Powerpoint."

Then for a while it was merely good.  Now, it's unfortunately a toxic company whose sole focus seems to be to squeeze as much money out of the customers and reduce costs via the grossly unfair performance management system.

There are some redeeming features.  The wages are around standard for the North East, there is a bonus scheme of up to 20% if you are in a global function, the building and surroundings are nice and you get 5 days where you can go an help out in a variety of charities etc.","The biggest problem Sage has at the moment is the cloud based strategy that they seem to be trying to force our customers onto.  The half year results seem to show that it's not something our customers want.  There also seems to be an excessive focus on selling, as opposed to giving good customer service and as a result technical support people also have sales targets.  There's been and continues to be a massive brain drain as more experienced people get sick and leave.

The second major gripe is the performance management system.  We were promised that last years ""stacked rankings"" had been discontinued, but it has become apparent this is not the case.  This means that you always have to have some people in the lower part of the scale, which means an immediate performance improvement plan.  I've luckily avoided this so far, but I'm aware of people who in no way could be said to be not doing their job being put onto these, which is unfair and causes unnecessary stress.  Perhaps Sage does have a performance problem, I don't know but introducing such an arbitrary way of marking people down is terrible.

Another side-effect of the performance management is that it encourages negative behaviours amongst colleagues with people sacrificing others to save their own skin.  As you'd imagine it doesn't make for the best working atmosphere at times.

The company has also become extremely top-heavy.  Almost weekly we get a new VP or EVP of something or other and people don't really know what they do!"

While I was working there, they ditched the employee bonus scheme, and gave us a pennies per hour pay rise instead, which left me about £200/year worse off. But the board kept their bonuses flowing.

For example, if you work for GBS, you may not get a lot of learning opportunities or flexibility in your work timings given the fact that its a Services division and you cater directly to customers and most of the things are governed by their own compliance policies like having to mandatorily work from the office due to the secure nature of the project, etc.

This review is for the IBM Software Labs.

1. Great learning opportunities as you have DevOps, Watson and latest cloud tech to work on.
2. You have all the available tools for self-learning and full admin access on your company laptop to install any tool approved by the company and be innovative.
3. There is a lot of flexibility in the timings which of-course depends on your manager and your work.
4. Leaves are not an issue. You have unlimited sick and casual leaves subject to approval and responsible use.
5. You get a MAC Pro.
6. If you have worked long enough and have consistent good ratings, you have project managers willing to take you in their project even though you may not be new to the technology. They have faith on you that you will pick up soon.
7. If you are really smart, you can make really good incentives by filing patents and its encouraged. Anyone can file patent, even if you are a fresher.
8. The only company that doesn't count the in-time and out-time. They trust their employee. Again this is subject to your manager.

With all that said, there can ofcourse be exceptions to the above like every other company. I have seen the worst and the best in this company and if you have a little patience with this company and get yourself in the right project with the right manager, you are good.

Remember, you never leave a company, you leave your manager.","1. IBM is still lacking in the compensation department. The payouts are not very competitive as compared to other product companies. For services, it may be at par.
2. Recently, there has been an effort on co-locating the employees and talks of removing 'work from home' policies which is really not required. This actually inconvenience the employees and reduces productivity and has been one of the perks of working in IBM which encourages employees to invest more time in the work."

During placement year I was really allowed to progress, by the end of the placement I was undertaking a number of big (for placement year) responsibilities. I was intergrated fully into the site team and welcomed from the very begining.

The HR & training teams allowed me to attend serveral training courses I thought would be left until becoming a full time employee, but from earliy on they were investing in my development.
- week long Site Surveying Course, 4 star hotel paid for, food & travel expenses
- during placement completed level 3 NVQ allowing progression to Gold CSCS
- CSCS test and card paid and organised by Balfour Beatty

All work travel expenses paid, which is a huge help when working in london, travel card £300+ a month!!

Good social scene and atmosphere between all areas of the company I came into contact with.

Most importantly I was able to learn a great, great deal during my placement year from the experienced people I was able to work with. Built hugely on the theoretical knowledge from university and lots of opportunities to put it into practice. Whilst working on the project I was considered a full member of the site team, not as 'the uni student' to be kept to simple tasks. I was given as much work as  could handle and able to work using my own initative regularily (not constantly checked and monitored) which gave me a great feeling of trust.

Whilst there I had great feed back from the site team, project office team, and the project director on my progress.

It was a great working year and I have recently been offered a graduate position once completing my degree, which I accepted straight away. If you have the opportunity to carry out a placement with Balfour Beatty I would strongly accept it, not just on site though. Through the friends I met at the company also on placements based off site they feel the same way.","- Due to the nature of the job you may need to work additional hours without overtime, but the salary you recieve takes this into account and any person in a managment position on site needs to accept this.
- You may get moved about as projects are completed or to where you are needed most, but I like this aspect of the job."

Many staff are passionate about cars which is great if you're also into that","IT division is very backward. The issues stem from the senior and middle management. Most make huge efforts to avoid taking decisions and responsibility. A few are very keen but end up loaded with so much pressure that they can only focus on immediate priorities, so overall there is very little planning for the future and very little innovation, it's all firefighting.

Too many of the management are not from an IT background at all - JLR prefer to recruit internally so they take people from mechnical engineering, management or even production line backgrounds.

Huge reliance on contractors because of the lack of specialist IT skills. Some are great but others do very little work and stay for years on great pay.

Lots of red tape - the worst I have seen. The processes are rigid but often not best practice.

Huge use of offshore Tata Group consultancy for development. Individually some developers are great, but many are grads who are trained to standards 10 years behind best practice. Collectively it is poorly managed. Timescales are rarely met and communication is poor, but they are not held accountable as they will always be used next time rather than going externally.

Because of the above issues, many projects go around for years, at great expense but never getting anywhere. By the time they come around again, the original people have left and everything is repeated. Factory staff rightly have huge distrust of IT for this reason, and work around the IT processes, leading to further problems and difficultly engaging."

Luckily, the partners and the engine they built are so good that the business continues to thrive just by closing big deals and executing on them successfully. They are trying hard to innovate and nurture a different culture they sense is coming but ultimately they don't get it. All innovation is top down driven, needs to look and feel the same as what the partnership has been comfortable doing for the last 10-20 years which filters out 80% of what innovation is about. The culture is still all network based (who you know and help is your currency) and if you look, speak and think differently you will stand out as an outcast despite how successful you may be.

While the results may vary, the effort seems to really be there.

- Work Life balance is excellent in all the teams I've worked in/got to know, and most people I've meet seems content. The only rare days I left late was due to me being engrossed by a piece of work, and never due to a looming deadline.

- There are a lot of initiative on environment preservation, well being and about underrepresented group,  and on trying to make the right thing.

- Benefits like pension and medical are good, but don't expect many standard tech companies 'freeebies'. (we're a public company after all, can't splurge that taxpayer money on anything but the most basic instant coffee!)

- The company is trying hard to improve its work methods by pushing agile and modern development techniques/stacks.

- Canteen in Salford might not be the cheapest but I'll forever miss those Pork Burritos.

All in all, it a positive experience where I learned a lot and met people I loved to work with every day. Would probably have stayed longer if progression was faster and extra effort rewarded, and if the team were given more freedom in the tech choices","- Progression and pay: Last year all progression and pay reviews for Design+Engineering were frozen, with various (empty) promises of something better coming alongside ""soon"". This, alongside salary band that are nothing to write home about, means that you have to negotiate yourself a good Salary when you join because it won't change by much for a long time. While your colleague might recognise and cherish your hard work and achievements, that won't speed up the pace of your career.

- A lot of internal, baroque tooling and framework being used, leading to very poor engineer experience and lot of extremely domain-specific knowledge and expertise which makes it hard to on-board new people, and has little value outside the BBC.

- Red tape. Red tape everywhere: Too many 'heads of something', 'senior manager of something else'. Company tree is not that deep, but sure has lots of branches and lots of Stakeholder to approve your work.

- The culture still feels very TV (and Radio, maybe) first, with Digital just being that ""also there"" thing.

- Very little/no giving back to open source :("

Poor communication and too many instances where the ‘customer is always right’ when they are clearly far from it. I was a witness to an incident between a member of staff and a customer, and Management took the side of the customer. My colleague got a disciplinary for sticking up for herself. Zero tolerance doesn’t exist.  Progression is encouraged, but applications have to be agreed by your Line Manager and when you request it you are told ‘you’re business critical’ so no, you are not allowed to further yourself. Staff will lose morale quickly. If you have had work related health issues then be prepared for little backup from managers, a disregard of OHS advice and the threat of termination of employment (no longer sustainable to business needs; even if it is work related). If you don’t meet the ‘there are no targets anymore’ targets it does get mentioned. To anyone thinking of working for this company; read all the reviews from customer facing staff (Work Coaches, primarily) for the real picture. Some older staff are institutionalised and happily shrug off work where possible. The work/life balance advertised is good, unless you are looking for leave during school holidays.  The continual add ons to our time are becoming ridiculous. There are only so many hours in the day to interview."

They have big company benefits and name recognition which bolster your resume and IBM is highly regarded in the industry. One of the biggest benefits to working for IBM is the ability to work from a home office, which saves you time and money by removing the commute from your daily routine, although IBM does get that commute time back from you in extra hours worked. Another great advantage to working for IBM is exposure to insiders at Fortune 500 companies that may help you in your job search once you're thoroughly disgusted with IBM.","IBM no longer has respect for the individual. Employees are treated as commodities. Benefits have eroded and IBM no longer pays market for their skills. Some items that are touted as benefits (such as tuition reimbursement) are not available for the employee population at large. IBM used to have a pretty good bonus program (variable pay) but the percentages have tumbled even as the stock has risen to a 7 year high. IBM touts itself as a company that supports work-life balance, but the truth of the matter is that they've laid off so many people that the folks that are left (that haven't been reclassified as non-exempt workers) are forced to work more hours to get the same job done. Also, IBM lags other companies in their own leveraging of technology. My advice: if you have a comparable offer elsewhere, take it. If you work for IBM in the US and haven't already been offshored, it's just a matter of time. 

IBM is so process-heavy that it can't get out of it's own way. People in IBM use the ""process"" to avoid doing the right thing for the customer.  Way too much red tape for my taste and the customer always takes a back seat to whatever IBM's pet program is at the time."

They also have a 401k plan.   Not much else.,"Bank of New York is the most bureaucratic company that I have ever seen.  Often, tasks are divided up among so many organizations that no one has ownership of any single initiative or project, so when it fails or fails to be completed, no one is responsible.

The organization is filled with many groups with overlapping responsibilities.  While the bank thinks that it is becoming lean and mean, it is not, as these groups, all with their own agendas, cancel each other out and make moving any initiative forward a morass.  

Management is tentative and uncertain on how to make changes.  It is the most incompetent management, I have ever seen within the 14-15 companies that I have worked for wqithin my career.         

There is almost no concern for quality of any product or service produced.  Management does not engage with line employees and does its best to ignore problems which affect quality and output of work.  There is no meaningful incentive for employees to work hard or be effective.  Most employees are therefore not motivated and take as many opportunities as possible to move the problem ""off their desk"" without fixing it."

Quality and range of exit opportunities are pretty comparable to MBB, albeit you won't have the name recognition.  If you see yourself leaning more towards a career in the technology industry (PM, data scientist), this place will prepare you far better than traditional consulting.  

APT has a phenomenal business outlook.  When I joined, the company was growing 25% YoY, and still is today.  In fact, some of our biggest problems involve having too many things to do for its consultants.

The people here are exceptional, and are very open to giving feedback, should you ask for it.  

The company is not yet a household name within consulting, but has some level of name recognition amongst recruiters, consultants, clients, and classmates.  Despite this, APT has excellent business school placements - this year, we have 2 people in our SF office (~45 people) alone going to HBS.  In the DC office, I know of several more who are going to Stanford GSB.  

There is a wide variety of tasks that business consultants are exposed to, including data manipulation, analysis, presentation, and client relationship building.  We work with a wide number of industries, spanning traditional retail, CPG, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, technology, restaurants, hotels, finance, etc.

The work life balance is generally good, and this is bolstered by a culture of traveling only when necessary.  Standing desks, monitors, keyboards, noise cancelling headphones, and more are all provided to consultants to help them be more productive.  

There is room for international travel, and transfers across roles (e.g. consulting to marketing to product management) or regions (SF to DC to Australia to Taipei) still occur every year.","APT staffs its consultants across a number of clients.  Most consultants here are on at least 5 clients, which means that the work can be very spiky.  
	
	Compensation is the best in the consulting industry for the entry level, but is quickly outpaced around 2-3 years in.  This growth rate will be irrelevant if you only plan on staying 2 years or less.  
	
	Due to lots of turnover across consulting clients, consultants need to constantly retrain new non-technical employees in the complicated analytics that our software performs.  Helping clients figure out which buttons to click is a tremendous exercise in frustration.  The work can quickly become repetitive, but that is also due to how effective the software is at mapping a diverse set of problems down to the same problem - test vs. control scientific experimental design and analysis.
	
	There is a huge amount of turnover in the SF office, which leads to consultants often being asked to fix things that are poorly documented, without any original context."

A truly horrible place to work. Good ol’ boy culture, and also a “No-culture culture”. Everyone works so hard that there is no incentive to really connect with peers. 

-Lack of diversity with old men who feel like they can disrespect you by being exceptionally rude or by making lewd comments.  Literally had a partner start to hit on me and then his admin put him in check. A couple older partners who are dated and feel that they can be a**holes to their admin and lower staff because of tenure and how much money they bring in. 

-No work-life balance (was literally told I shouldn’t be saying “no” to any work even though I was over capacity). A principal I spoke to essentially said that the only way for me to progress was to not have any boundaries with work. It was only after 12+ years of really hard work (like constant nights and weekends) in the business did they finally respect this person’s request to set boundaries so they could spend time with family.

- no raises; lack of communication about raises and how to get a raise (most likely bc they didn’t do that)
- no career development discussions unless initiated by yourself
- no mentorship in place unless you ask someone specifically
- no regular feedback of performance
- siloed work environment 
- leadership and partners are not invested in your growth or you as a person- only the work you can produce

Research work SUCKS. I was told there would be more variety in this particular role but that is simply not the truth. The majority of your work (like 90-95%) is using various databases like LinkedIn and Zoom to find candidates and then spending hours plugging them into the KF database and updating candidate profiles. Barely interact with candidates and definitely next to no interaction with clients. Not intellectually challenging or stimulating.  Only occasionally did I get to help create deliverables."

2. Bank has spent lot of money and focus on infrastructure, automation and internal processes which work well like a well-oiled engine. Other banks haven't invested so much in infrastructure and automation processes for employees within company (this is from my personal experience of working in three banks here in Singapore).
3. Good opportunity to learn and grow if you have right people with you.
4. You get the flexible hours of working. I could work from home without any issues and my managers supported it. 
5. Company culture was good for learning and helped me a lot in learning new stuff.
6. Despite of not having a local manager in Singapore for 4 years, I never felt neglected and was well rewarded and taken care of my hard work by my managers in UK. (Previously, my local managers were horrible).
7. Company gives amazing redundancy package and is very generous in giving compensation. They are one of the best and will take care of you financially if your position is being made redundant. 
8. If your position would be made redundant, you could apply for positions in other departments (if available) or other low cost locations if you are willing to locate. 
9. If you are happy to relocate to low cost locations, you could apply to a higher position and get a promotion (provided you are in company for a while).
10. Per Singapore standards, they had ample leave plans (annual leaves, hospitalization, maternity and sabbatical).
11. Healthcare insurance plan was one of the best (includes dental and family).
12. Despite of your experience, if
- you are working hard and your manager recognizes it and fights for you.
Or 
- you have charmed right people enough (despite of not working much), you have better chances of promotion.
You will get promoted. People don't judge you from your experience, they evaluate based on your calibre and strength.","1. Due to flat hierarchy in designations, it was frustrating to move to next position. When their IT base in Singapore was huge, it was too much competition and less promotions. However, it became better post 2011/2012 once their IT strength was reduced. 
2. When they had Offshore development centre (ODC) concept in Singapore, they had horrible procedures, bureaucracy and horrible leadership. Situation became 100% better once our department directly started reporting to managers in UK. Prior to 2011, some of my local managers were horrible  and manipulative, they had no clue about management and leadership. Managers in UK were much better, at least they were honest and upfront about career and opportunities guidelines. Basically no bullsh*t.
3. They were pay masters 6-7 years back, now their salary does not match with current market scale.
4. IT in Barclays Singapore has reduced almost 90% in past 3-4 years, if you have been offered a position after 2014 either your team is really required here or your position might be retained only for short time. They have major plans to cut down in Singapore. If you are already working there and it has been only 2-3 years, search for a better job with good compensation. Severance package is good, however, only worth waiting for people who have been there for a while.
5. Promotion process is extremely horrible. You would be interviewed for the position by Senior Managers, someone who has never heard of you might have a say in your promotion depending upon how well you were in interview, it doesn't matter how well you performed in last few years. Even your line manager can't help you sometimes. However, if you have managed to influence people well, you would get promoted easily - you don't have to work hard then. Recently they announced that you could only get promotion only if they have positions otherwise you can't move ahead which is even worse. (However, if there is a position in another department vacant, you could apply for it and get promotion which is better. The catch is most of these positions were in low-cost locations and if you are in high-cost location, you don't have many options then).
6. Due to cost cutting and move to low cost locations, their quality of service has declined a bit."

Layoffs were pretty awful. People just disappeared-- managers didn't say anything before, your coworkers just weren't there anymore, people you cared about and got close to-- gone. Again, the firm does not care. They do not care about you, there is no loyalty to you. 

The hours are long and thankless in ops. 10 hours minimum every day. Never had less than a ten hour day.

Work life balance is virtually nonexistent. You exist to make money for the firm; they do not care about you. 

Management spends a lot of time trying to talk up how great it is to work in ops, but everyone's trying to get out. Ops is where careers go to die; it is the red headed stepchild of the firm. You know how everyone associates Goldman with Wolf of Wall Street types? Well in Ops, you're the one on the other end of the phone when said wolf picks up the phone to scream about a failing trade. It's purely extractive and exploitative. Do not listen to anyone who's trying to tell you that you'll have a long and satisfying career in ops. You'll be strategizing the entire time about getting away to another division, and getting to a prestige office.

In ops, you'll never get the choice of anything. New office building? Nope. New facilities? Nope. Healthier food? No. Central location? No, we're going to put you in the far office. Everything in ops feels punitive."

The perks of traveling add up to free hotel nights, flights, and other reward programs you enroll yourself in. I hear bonuses are pretty amazing and the opportunity for growth is huge. Amazing benefits.","All of the pros come at a price. In my experience, I was traveling to my client site for a year Sunday nights to Friday nights- I was only home for a 24 hour period each week and required to work 7 AM to midnight most nights. I was typically also required to work weekends and was never able to take a single holiday during my time nor any PTO. Specific to my team, I wasn't even allowed to have a say in what I ate for lunch or dinner due to tight timelines- one member of the team would decide where they were going and have to grab lunch for everyone. Even though I was given 5 weeks of PTO, in my entire time there I only used 2 weeks and got a huge payout when I left. The environment is very competitive and not collaborative at all and favoritism is rampant. Some people live for this kind of life and culture and a lot of my team members enjoyed it. However, I value being able to spend time with family, have work/life balance, and work among people who are collaborative and supportive. This was not the environment for me."

As a student, gives amazing flexibility and saves time travelling from college to work(home). Great support system in place, weekly team meetings. Time allocated for training and one on one with manager. 

If you are a problem solver, you will genuinely enjoy a lot of the calls. Added satisfaction from helping people in most cases.

Amazing training for the job, all paid. Top class, about 6 weeks in total, you will be totally prepared to take calls, no matter your skill level coming into the organisation. As well as continuous training when you are on the phones. 

Opportunities to progress.","Can lead to feeling isolated. This is down to the advisor in my opinion, if you are not communicating with your team, manager etc.. and not participating in meetings. Working from home will not work for everyone. Important to have a social life outside of work! Leave the house everyday!

During busy periods calls can be very frequent - 7 seconds between calls. On the other hand, there are quiet periods too! Can get a lot of anger from customers directed at you, have to be someone with ability to take an objective approach and have thick skin.

Senior advisors can be rude and unhelpful when you contact them for help, especially if you want them to take the call over, whether the matter is in the customer's best interest / by protocol or not. This is not always the case but can get senior advisors with this attitude. Most senior advisors will be helpful. 

Opportunities to progress, but only within your current role i.e. up the support department ladder. In my experience, as a student, management do not want to hear about progressing into other departments such as development, testing or data analytics. You can apply for these roles internally, but there is a conflict of interest for management if you are valuable to your team."

- The lunch is good, and it costs around 2.5 euros, already included in your payslip, which is a great deal for the Netherlands. 
- The offices are quite nice, usual perks such as fruit, coffee. 
 - If you are lucky, you get a good manager that will help you grow.
 - *most* of the teams have a good work/life balance","- This was the company I've been disappointed the fastest in my career, realised it was not a good company after 3 months being in there.
 - The company embaraces and promotes people that firefights issues in production, the type of people that can find the bug on the spaghetti code put into production and fix it fast. On the other hand, if you are a person that likes to be preventive, tries to push for better coding practices, promotes the development of tests in order to AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE future issues in production, you will get nothing. I had a manager that told me that ""writing tests was slowing us down"", and I must stop writing them. 
 - There is a big monolith written in Perl. Having a monolith is not bad per se, coding in Perl is not bad per se. Having a monolith in perl without proper ownership of teams through the code, with people pushing changes without even testing them, with people making deploys and not caring about anything during the process, is horrible and painful. If I had known this before joining, I would have not joined at all. 
 - All the people I referred had a horrible experience on the interview process, which tells me that 1) I was lucky in the recruitment process, and 2) there are a lot of unprofessional people working in HR. 
 - I did not experience it myself, but there are a lot of burnout cases through the company (I personally know 2 cases). Most of them are a consequence of bad managers. There are a lot of good managers but most of them will not shine, as they are not showponies. 
 - There are a lot of retaliation cases, also did not happen to me but it did to a close friend. If you decide to join, do get well with your manager. 
 - If you want to grow in there, you need to have 3 things:
        - excellent communication skills 
        - excellent commercial awareness. 
        - speed coding and pushing changes fast. Quality of your code is not important at all (unless you get a good manager). 
 - Being a team lead sucks, as you will have way more responsibilities than the developers, but the difference on the payslip is between 0 and 5%. 
 - During the interview process they will tell you that they will support your partner on finding a job. That is a huge lie. The only thing they do is give him/her a couple of CV trainings."

Many of the Partners have come through the ranks from consultants - in some ways it’s great to see this opportunity, but unfortunately you’re left with a set of institutionalised Partners that have never worked anywhere else and are actually pretty inexperienced. This would explain some poor behaviours amongst some Partners that would not be accepted elsewhere. 

The partnership model also has its issues - this is not a hierarchical business with strong management top-down, but run more like a democracy. What you’re left with is a diluted strategy. For example some Partners wanted to do more with SAP, but others see the risks so the firm at the moment is generally not a hands on SAP System Integrator but more a Business Integrator - perhaps the recent acquisition of Keytree will change this."

There is virtually zero effort by the company to retain workers during a strong job market.  Turnover is extremely high, leaving a perpetual knowledge gap. Employees with a year of tenure shouldn't be the ""old guys""... 

After some experience, you'll generally be doing the same work as Core counterparts, but at a portion of the pay.  What incentive is there to stick around when competing firms are offering 50-100% raises for the same work (ex: Workday, Oracle practices)? 

There is no discernible culture, no team building events, parties, etc. You go to work to work and nothing else.  

401k match is completely laughable at 1.5% vested over 4 years.

It's pretty cool knowing the most detailed business information about some of the most highly respected and admired American businesses. 

Training and support structure is very robust and there is never a time where you have nowhere to turn for answers. Coaching is very integrated into the PwC experience and you always have a upward place to comfortably turn for answers, advice, and guidance. Workplace technology is generally very good and IT provides state of the art laptops and external displays for work. 

While monetary compensation is not the best, the benefits package is broad in other ways including full cell phone with unlimited data, unlimited sick time, generous vacation and extended firm holidays, sabbaticals, maternity/paternity leave, and insurance options (including a very convenient legal option). Promotion and pay is highly structured and predictable (and therefore stable). Jobs are essentially 100% secure, unless you make some serious, serious mistakes consistently. Exit options are very strong as well, as long as you want to do something related after exit.

One thing that is surprisingly good is flexibility. You generally have a set amount of work to complete each day/week. I've never had an issue leaving whenever I wanted for doctor's appointments, concerts, sporting events, or Flexed Fridays as long as my work was completed.","The work is incredibly boring and repetitive, especially in your first 5-7 years. I did not study an accounting or MIS related field and coming to work at PwC was a huge mistake. The firm has recently made a push into recruiting in other fields such as Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, and Computer Science but frankly the job has not come along enough to provide valuable and interesting work to employees from these backgrounds. HR and recruiting like to pitch the consulting aspect of our job to students, but we're really not consultants, unless you're working in the Advisory LOS. At the end of the day, I am an auditor through and through, regardless of working in risk assurance. 

During busy season, the hours can be very long (75+) which can be frustrating because upper management is always communicating how hard they're working to line up enough busy season resources. The pay is also not that great considering how hard we are expected to work and the challenging and stressful nature of the work itself. Associates often run budgets on engagements and are aware of what PwC is charging the client for their work. Associates normally cost about $180-$250/hour for the client. It's almost insulting to take home only about 10% of that amount or less per hour.

The firm culture is not positive and most people seem to be very unhappy. I don't think a single day goes by where I don't hear someone joking about how much they hate their job or fantasizing about leaving. When someone does leave, it's the envious talk of the office. I think at the end of the day, the nice office, decent pay and benefits, and highly structured and dependable promotion scheme trap people into staying. 

85% of my client contacts have been awful, miserable people. This work is highly client facing and I spend about 30% of my days interacting with contacts. I have found that most people automatically dislike auditors and it seems a lot of people who work in private compliance and risk are just generally disagreeable and miserable people. I can't tell you how many rude emails and phone calls I've had to smile through and endure.

Exit opportunities, while strong in the industry, are weak elsewhere. If you intend to leave PwC and the accounting/audit industry, you had better do it no later than 2-3 years after starting or you will find yourself trapped.

Additionally, my experience with PwC has been HIGHLY clique-y. Managers, directors, and partners quickly establish favorites amongst the staff (generally attractive, athletic, white males) regardless of actual work ability and intelligence. These favorites then get staffed on the best and most interesting work, or the work with the largest expense allowances (think $150 dinners). The nature of this work is then positively reinforcing allowing the favorites to be promoted more quickly. It seems the best way to succeed in my department is not actually working hard, but excelling at convincing others how hard you're working. Upper management is essentially 95% WASP-y white males who complain consistently about millennials, rather than trying to create a workplace consistent with today's working generation.

PwC recently implemented a ""Professional Framework"" by which performance is evaluated according to 5 characteristics (Whole Leadership, Business Acumen, Global Acumen, Technical Skills, Relationships) Global acumen is essentially worthless. ""Performance differentiators"" highlight unique contributions to engagements. During each engagement, you receive a ""Snapshot"" detailing each of these categories being below, partially at, at, partially at, or at next level. These snapshots are reviewed during your Career Roundtable (which you are not present for) and this determines your promotion and pay. This is what bothers me most about PwC. Most engagement staffing comes down to luck or favoritism. If you're placed on new work, it is relatively easy to stand out and contribute substantially to work improvement and earn performance differentiators. If you're placed on a ""bread and butter"" client, for which we've been providing the same service for 20 years, there is essentially nothing left to improve. During your Career Roundtable, the upper management evaluate your snapshots and essentially assign you as a ""1,"" ""2,"" or ""3,"" with 1 being the highest performing. About 1 in 30 employees is a ""1."" This then determines your pay increase. The Professional Framework was implemented to make performance, promotion, and pay more transparent. But at the Career Roundtable, upper management can still voice their favorites and override the Snapshots to assign 1s, 2s, and 3s. In my mind, this makes the Snapshots irrelevant. As long as there is a human component in the ranking assignment, I don't view this as a fair or equitable process. Best chance at promotion? Make sure you can talk football/hockey/baseball and smalltalk with old white men."

Just secured a host position (which didn't exist when I started) and only did that because I called my manager's bluff. I came to PI with 3 years' management experience and 3 years' hospitality experience plus my degree and am little more than a waitress 3 years later. I've stayed due to loyalty and the vain hope that something will improve but in this time I've had a succession of managers in 3 sites who have failed to develop or talent manage me (and others). I've been banned from applying to move to another site, banned from applying for AOM positions even though as an external candidate I more than fit the essential and desirable criteria. I have a near perfect attendance record, am entirely flexibe in my role working shifts and hours which nobody else wants to work for the business need, I am thoroughly conversant with all ground floor operations, I've even done a stint in the kitchen. Now I've spent £10,000 on a masters degree so that I can leave and repair the damage to my career.  Especially given that almost 3  years after completing Bronze Shooting Stars I'm told I have to do it again as it's now out of date. I abaondoned the level 3 apprenticeship when I was being forced to resit my functional skills level 2 in Maths and English when I had A's from my GCSE's and AS levels in both. The main problem is managers who don't understand management, no clue on motivation, team building or talent management at all. No regard for strategics, too eager to give customers freebies and refunds rather than deal with issues, override ground floor crew and make us/them look totally incompetent. One of the real problems is that there is no staff record. No file, no development plan ... nothing. So when a new manager ships in they know nothing about the team they have, nothing about what you've agreed with previous managers, nothing about your history with the company or prior to working with PI and nothing about where you thought you were heading. It all resets back to 0 and you're on the climb from the bottom again, it's like a game of snakes and ladders and there are way too many snakes and nowhere near enough ladders. One of the best ways to achieve promotion is to be so bad at your job that nobody wants you so they ship you out and I'm way too professional, dedicated and hard working to do that. I've come to the conclusion that to be a manager at Premier Inn I would have to totally deskill myself and dumb down and I'm not prepared to do this so I'm not going to stick around.

I believe there is a residual lack of professionalism fostered by the previous cluster manager who I was told when I first started is not happy unless she leaves a meeting with everyone crying (never worked on me although she tried very hard) and it needs cutting out."

Nothing Else. Honestly thats the only pro i can state.,"Too much work for sales assistants (if you work for the company you know what i mean).

Doing managerial jobs which are the managements responsibility such as C dates, rotation, running shifts, covering shifts etc. And we dont get anything extra for it unlike management who get a salary and duties who get an extra £1 an hour. 

Having to come to work in the morning when your sick because you start at the same time as the manager at 6.00am and because Lidl only provide 1 or 2 staff member apart from the manager to work the delivery.  And you cannot go home mid shift but make you work the entire shift. 

Pulling heavy pallets, preping the bake, working the ambient, cleaning breakages and doing priorities all while running up and down to serve customers on the till who get very angry because they had to wait before they could be served. Long queus of customers all very angry. 

You never finish your shift on time whether its because they cash you up late or they force you to stay longer. 

Breaks are not given and you are forced to work long 12 14 hour shifts non stop. If you do get a break by chance they are never long anough normally 15mins and are always interupted by management. You are also not allowed to leave the store when its only 1 on 1 staff. 

Having to clean toilets even though that was not part of the job description. The company just piles more and more work. Hygiene issues. 

No uniform given! Iv been wearing the same shirt for nearly 2 years because Lidl will not supply the store with more uniform! 

Managers get the easy shifts and jobs were as sales assistants have to work all the weekends, bank holidays, xmas eve, new years eve and wednesday and sunday closes which are Lidls setup days. Managers favour management. 

Having to play security although its not my job and puts my safety at risk. And yes people do pull out weapons in store. And any loss shown after inventories is automatically put on the heads of sales assistants. 

Managers clock you out before you finish so that their prod points do not get affected. We lose out a heck of alot of money and we cannot do anything about it as the company turns a blind eye! 

The employee survey in 2014 was a complete joke as managers forced employees to take part and we even was forced to write what they wanted. A complete joke because in all my time i know Lidl does not listen or care for its staff. Managers get bonuses, company cars, extra holidays, free healthcare and all we sales assistants get is a crappy discount card! Sales assistants are the ones who do all the work and management are the ones getting all the rewards! 

You do not get overtime rate, double pay or night right. Just one rate for everything. Therefore the hourly rate Lidl provides is much worse than any other company. For example Asda provide double discount days, bonuses, gift cards, night rate, double pay, triple pay on queens jubilee and the rotal wedding. Lidl sucks.

No canteen facilities, even the microwave is broken. Meaning no hot food or drink. 
No lockers as they are all broken beyond repair. 

managers not letting you count the tills so that if your down it goes against you. 

Cameras literally outside the canteen with a clear view inside. Feel watched all the time even in the warehouse. The till speed is always monitored as is all if the till actions taking place. 

Managers screaming and shouting at staff which is deeply dehumanising and makes you want to crawl up into a little ball. Customers often feel its also wrong but they do not care as long as their shopping is off the till and back into the trolley. 

Holidays magically dissappear even though you booked them months in advance. 

NO TRAINING GIVEN TO NEW STARTERS! Iv been with the company 6 years and seen new starters face hell!"

They were winning deals and taking names.  I was evaluating a higher base salary at another firm or a good salary plus a potentially higher bonus plan with Ryan.  
All other benefits being pretty square, the variable was me.  I took a leap of faith - on myself.  I went with my gut instincts and my only regret, 4.5 years later, was not doing it sooner.  
1)   A highly engaged executive team that is accessible, (truly) cares about employees, listens and takes brisk action when necessary.  (This makes a real difference.  Changes at big 4 are painfully slow.) 
2)   Ryan provides a perfect balance of market presence and resources coupled with unmatched high growth. The result is an environment which allows for talented individuals to thrive and grow. 
3)   Hands down - the best work environment.  My experience at 2 big 4 firms and one small firm (200 people) provide good perspective. Please do not underestimate the importance of this factor.  Work and life, for me, run hand in hand.  It is critical to make the right decision.  If you are considering a role at Ryan and you believe in yourself the choice is clear.","Growing pains are a natural course of a high growth business.  Ryan is implementing systems, updating software, hiring the right professionals to manage how prospects and targets can be allocated to best serve the firm.  The con is that this takes some time to work out the kinks, get it right and then get everyone on-board with the new processes."

Bad overall position.,"If you're new to the IT industry with some background, you'll have a chance to get hired in. 
Church has good benefits. 
Nice people to work with. 
Compared to most call centers, you're working with members of the church. Seldom do you get distressed/upset employees calling in.","I came in as a part-time employee seeking full-time employment. I was looked at favorably to be promoted quickly but after a seasoned manager ""left"" my fate was left up to the politics of hiring with the new managers of the team. Which were, they favored married individuals, with families, school, etc over individuals who were just single such as myself. I saw this time and time again where I would have more time and experience at the GSC and was still placed second behind that group. Management is new so their hiring skills are rather incompetent. I was micromanaged and it was unpleasant. I felt undervalued and my work unappreciated. I felt management didn't care about me as an individual. Feedback was poor and did not help me improve in any way. Even after I had made the changes they requested, they did pay any attention.  I was looking forward to continue working for the church, I took a massive pay and time cut but clearly that didn't matter to them. When management had changed, people were realizing they could go elsewhere with a better environment. Employees were dropping faster than they could hire. We were moving into the ""Slow season"" and I was constantly on calls the moment I got in and we were scolded if we took too long of breaks or lunches or heaven forbid work on a ticket a little longer, yet they failed to hire more employees. 
Food is way overpriced, and there is nowhere else to get food unless you want to jog to crown burger and be late anyway. 
The hours were bad for me, I could only work 28 hours a week and was traveling long distances. There are only a few slots per team that are allowed full-time. About 15 or so per team and around 3 individuals per team get full-time. I won't go back to the GSC."

Even with 20 years experience in IT, learning and development and Management you get stuck in a store and you won't escape. They go on about better jobs for Partners, but they don't value experience or views. Bonus and profits have dived and daily you get involved in sorting customers deliverys which have gone wrong and no one takes responsibility!

Jobs you apply for are earmarked for Partners already in those teams and you have no chance of breaking through. You take your time and money going to these but they are a waste of time. Silver medalist pot is pointless as when you pass the benchmark no one calls you or invites you for a chat about the job! What's the point!

They no longer care about Partners and waiting for feedback for interviews is a nightmare... Sometimes you wait 14 days for an answer on your application, very down heartening .

I loved this business so much however it is now full of disappointment and regret.

Everyone will realise in the end that there is no progression, opportunities or real tangible learning. 

Visits from Head office Partners, make you feel inferior and dismiss any ideas of improvement... They have to prove every project will work regardless of the results or partner experience.

Good work/life balance.
If your face fits, you'll go far.","The level of the job means I shouldn't care about work once I walk out of the door, however I am always anxious that one day the axe will land on my job, and I will be facing redundancy or redeployment. The culture of fear over my job has created an unpleasant work and home life for me.

No respect from managers. Just spoken to like garbage and expected to do an ever-increasing amount of work with little or no extra support.

If your face doesn't fit, you won't go anywhere.

Tesco likes to promote itself as inclusive, but the levels of homophobia and transphobia among certain colleagues is off the charts. Even worse, management and senior team turn a blind eye to such remarks, unless they are being specifically directed against a customer or colleague, or done in a way that would make Tesco look bad. But out of earshot of those who it will hurt or offend, homophobia in abstract is a-okay.

And don't get me started on discrimination against people with physical or mental impairments. ""It feels like Remploy here"" is something I often hear the second someone with a disability is employed.

Tesco does not encourage colleagues to speak out about such things in a meaningful way. Yes, they have the protector line, and company policy is that you should speak to your line managers (or higher) about issues like this, but when the culture in my store seems to be ""don't rock the boat"", you have a good idea about what will happen if you do bring these things up."

Calls come in from all around the world.  Shift swaps are very lenient and easy to arrange.  As a Change Booking agent is is possible to earn small amounts of commission  - £50 for meeting monthly flight target, £100 for meeting monthly wrap target (time spent in between calls should average 140 seconds or less),  1% commission on all package holidays booked, 5 % commission on paid seat assignments sold once your seat target has been met.  A decent month for seat sales will give you an extra £40-50 or so. There are small shift premiums for working early/late or over the weekend. Overtime readily available at 1.5x, or occasionally 2x over sales/festive periods. Salary is reviewed on a year to year basis and goes up after the first year - currently from £15888 to £16678 or there abouts I believe.  The top management in office are excellent and friendly. The team leaders and duty managers are for the most part excellent and many are very knowledgeable too as they also take calls. There is a good support network if you need help with a call or with your own development as an agent. The six week training course was demanding yet fun.  Training is ongoing. There is often the opportunity to move to other departments internally; e.g. sales, customer relations, social media, recruiting, package holidays.","Stressful dealing with the occasional rude caller.  Often it is necessary to give difficult information to a customer.  It is important to have empathy but the role also requires you to stand your ground at times to ensure fairness and consistency.  Working with departments that have been outsourced to other companies can make certain aspects of the job testing at times and it is not always easy to be the voice of BA for the customer at these times.  It is not a 9-5 job - it is a 37.5 hour week, 5 days out of 7 typically and days off can be weekdays, weekends or a mixture of the two. The earliest shift starts at 6am and the latest finishes at 10pm which includes Sundays."

The CEO is amazing and some awesome colleagues. Plenty of young colleagues (if you're younger and starting out). Volunteering activities are great. Company is serious about philanthropy.,"Global Data is a joke and a revolving door for college grads. They make you go through a fairly lengthy interview process, but the full-time role is a joke. Trust me when I say that you're not doing anything finance related. You're in a back-office role doing manual data entry which can be automated at any time. In fact, Bloomberg is pushing for automation so I wouldn't be surprised to see Global Data dissolved. Also it really matters which team you land on. No matter what, STAY AWAY from fixed income. Specifically the mortgages team and to some extent bonds. You'll be going through all the same issues as everyone else in Global Data but with A LOT more work than your non-fixed income colleagues. Besides Global Data being a joke, be prepared to face A LOT of politics. There's politics all over the place. Since there's so many fresh college grads, it feels like college with college drama. ""Senior leaders"" are outdated. Some have been with the company for several decades simply because of their connections. In fact, since there's so many people for so few TL spots, the only way to move up is to be friends with management. You get ""unlimited sick days"" but no one takes them because there's a stigma. If you do end up taking one, if it's Friday or Monday, be ready to face judgement when you're back. Work from home is also so so hard to get. It's pretty basic these for companies to offer this, but the company doesn't want to set a standard of working from home daily. Thus, managers are encouraged to not let their teams work from home. As for career prospects after, there's very little. Poor at best. Think about it, you're not doing finance so no banks want you. Since you're doing data entry all day, you're not developing technical or finance skills. Also you're working with Bloomberg systems which isn't applicable to other companies. If you were working with SAP, Qlik, Tableau then that would actually be useful but you're not. Lastly, the location sucks. You're not in Princeton, you're in freaking- Skillman, New Jersey.

You will be overworked and under appreciated. 
There are clear favorites and it has nothing to do with the best performers - it’s usually the people the leadership feels strokes their egos the most.
The senior leadership in Norwalk leading the teams in Plainfield are probably the biggest problem of them all. Behavior starts from above.
I wouldn’t recommend this location but the company as a whole can be good
They are taking diversity way too far, I love seeing diverse leadership but ONLY when those people are qualified for their role (professional qualifications have gone out the window)

The all-pervading culture of blame and self-interest makes for a truly poisonous atmosphere. 

Imagine a stereotypical old-school salesman and everything that is awful about them. Now imagine a company run entirely by people like that. I have never seen so many unnecessary BMW and Audi company cars in one place. 
A perfect case-study for the Dunning-Kruger effect, with whole teams of people employed to do jobs that are then over-ruled and shut down by the autocrats in upper management, who truly believe they know better than the specialists they've employed. 

The relentless pursuit of sales at the cost of everything else, combined with a total disregard for the customer at every level is quite astonishing. 
Dishonesty is the default setting. Quality, service and customer satisfaction are so far down the list as to be non-existent. 
The fact that they are deliberately targeting the lower end of the market with low-quality tat and unnecessary bolt-on insurance products sold on ridiculous commission is just another reason to leave with a foul taste in your mouth. 

The pricing structure is as much a work of art as it is pure evil, designed entirely to skirt the edges of the FCA guidelines as closely as possible without getting caught. That being said, the simplest of audits would expose some entirely unsavoury practices in this place...  

The treatment of suppliers and third-party agencies is no better than that of the customers. Staff are treated with total disdain also, all while stuck in ridiculous dress-codes at head office in poor working environments. 

The real, true shame is that the actual staff are by and large great people that know what they are doing - if only they were allowed to get on and do it. 

Ultimately though, the top knobs have made themselves very rich by carrying on like this, so they have no compulsion to change anything at all. Stack 'em high, sell 'em cheap and treat everyone like idiots. I'm embarrassed to have this place on my CV."

And I was #1 on my team and #11 in the country. 

They claim compensation is great but when based in Atlanta you get the most bottom of the barrel accounts and this means everything (you have to deal with it). I've never worked so hard for a $2K deal... in. my. life. In my previous life, I never glimpsed at anything under $100K. That was for newer reps. If you sell a $100K deal, you will be at the top for the month and everyone freaks out. So what this means.... what they say you will get paid is a FAR stretch from reality. I was above my number and didn't make what they claimed because when I got my sales compensation package there are all these other factors. Therefore, I made SIGNIFICANTLY less here than my last job. The base was higher but that was it.

I'm a hunter and have always been one. Here, it does NOT make sense to focus on hunting because you get new accounts every year and for a prospect to switch CRM's this decision isn't made overnight. Don't let the recruiter tell you otherwise. Trust me.

Every current client that I did get, I had to do damage control from previous reps trying to squeeze every dollar out of them. The previous sales reps had their own agenda and it really hurt our clients. Because you get new accounts each year, the previous reps didn't care about the future. They did whatever it took to get $ and then dumped the client. I spent the first 6 months trying to get our clients not to leave us.

The office is LOUD because the desk are on top of each other with no sound barriers and all the conference rooms are booked. Clients made many comments about the background noise and it's embarrassing."

Things don't get much better than that.  I was at a dinner recently which had 90% investment bankers.  Gosh.  Those guys have no life, no hobbies, there is not a single thing they can talk about besides work, and they really have little personality.  McKinsey is NOT like that.  BUT, with all the traveling it can be hard to have a relationship.  Also, because you are treated so nicely all the time, it is possible to have a bloated sense of self-worth and seniority."

Starting salary is basic, but the commission you earn can significantly increase your overall earnings, providing you hit your targets. I felt that the majority of management I dealt with were fair with regards to taking sick leave, although I never really needed to aside from the 'once in a blue moon' illness.

Good networking with other colleagues in other departments mean I've made friends for life.

Opportunities to win rewards or prizes for hitting targets, but we're talking the top 1% in the company. Very difficult if you're working in a store where nobody cares.","Commission has dramatically decreased from when I first started. You're also reliant on the store hitting target before any money is paid to you. If you hit target, and the store does not, you immediately lose half of what you were going to get. Not good, when you're dealing with people who can't be bothered, call in sick or end up getting sacked.

Management are very hit and miss with regards to training. For the most part, I experienced training new starters myself on systems and procedures.

Shocking display of favouritism with regards to certain members of staff leads employees to truly believe it's not what you know, but who you know. This needs to change. There are talented members of staff who know not only their own role inside out, but roles above them. Some employees have been passed over for promotion, given to people who were 'flavour of the month' to later find out that they don't have the drive, knowledge or determination to succeed in that role.

City centre location is good.","The pay is poor.
The parameters for any bonus are vague and open to interpretation, and therefore comes down to the opinion of your manager.
Lower management are tick-box supervisors, with no interest in developing their staff. Their prime concern is flying under the radar of their bosses.
The systems are appalling and require a huge overhaul and investment tha the company is never going to make.
Training is weak, especially in areas such as CASS, where no attempt has been made to make it relevant to your role, and overall knowledge is learned through word of mouth from selected staff.
Work life balance depends on the manager so there are no guarantees. This is especially true if you are male.
Staff numbers have been cut by approx three quarters so it is doubtful if there is a long term future. This has been ongoing for over two years and the planning has been nonexistent, so staff have been allowed to leave with no plan as to how their work will be done in their absence.
Favouritism. People promoted into good management positions with no interview.
There is no real drive amongst management to tackle the major issues, such as training, the systems or the imbalance of knowledge held by a few and the office appears to be drifting.
There is zero connection between teams, except for lynx messaging or email. Only four floors but you can go months without seeing anyone from another department. Furthermore, some managers revel in closing ranks and making it as difficult as possible for other teams by refusing to allow their staff to assist other teams who need help.
The new Chief of Operations is invisible and is more concerned at name dropping her relationships with senior management.
Essentially, upper management have been so focussed on the reduction in staff numbers, they have completely dropped the ball in terms of general operations,"

* Coffee/tea anyone? That will cost you the SAME price as Starbucks...$1.60 and more...NO KIDDING! NOTHING IS FREE anymore! Cafeteria food quality has gone down and their prices are more than outside the IBM facilities!
* So as to save money in utilities, office supplies and workspace, IBM encourages work from home, thus, reducing team spirit and production.
* Salary and Raises? They are getting more and more skimpy and give team members identical excuses, regardless of performance.

Better culture, social club and more approachable (open floor plan, even for Partners) and personable staff than my experience with other big 4 audit firms. EY has won a number of awards for employee satisfaction, and the firm values its people highly. This may vary slightly from business unit to business unit however, and like most audit firms, there is still a high staff turnover.
- Excellent opportunities for career development and learning (recognised as a worldwide leader), as well as generous study support during the CA program and/or university. Excellent opportunities for promotion, secondment overseas, and this is strongly encouraged by senior staff. There are also open review processes, as well as upward feedback and inter-company assignments
- Benefits such as drinks nights, social events (movie premieres, sport days etc), a big Xmas party,, Grad camp, annual retreat etc. Top notch beer & wine at all such events
- Strong position in market, good client base and the firm is committed to market leadership and growth
- Nice leave opportunities during non-busy seasons, and offers of flex leave, TOIL and reward days off
- Nice, new building on George St which is convenient to get to by public transport.
- In-house gym","Many of these criticisms may be of the industry in general, and not specific to EY:
- Long hours. Especially during busy periods, there is an expectation of staff to work (at least) 40+ hours and weekends if necessary. Expect more ""work"" and less ""life"", especially on the lower rungs of the ladder, and even then most of your social life may revolve around work events
- Relatively lower salary compared to accounting positions in industry, and at some levels, also compared to other big 4 firms. Most staff stay until completing their CA and then jump ship to a cushy job outside public accounting
- Difficult to take leave around busy season (post year end) unless it is planned well in advance, and the busy periods stretch for a significant portion of the year, depending on the division
- The nature of the work is very sensitive to the economy and the business cycle - when the clients are making money its good times, otherwise expect downward pressure on budgets and wages, cutting of discretionary expenditure and benefits, as well as layoffs
- Its mainly auditing"

Absolutely no opportunities for growth. Management does not really care about growth of their employees - they just provide lip service with all the latest initiatives as they have to tackle the alarming attrition rate. 

Senior management is very old school and does not know how to run a 21st century knowledge shop. It is a very 1980's mafia style work culture. Loyalty and appearance of loyalty is prized above everything else. New York Times called it a 'digital white-collar sweatshop'.

There is no thought given to software processes - it is a single minded focus to get stuff out to clients as fast as possible without regards to quality. As a result the product is a hotchpotch mix of applications which no one understands how to use. In their rush to get products out they have made some really bad software decisions which they have then spent man-decades correcting."

Easy to succeed at job interview; B&M always on the lookout for new staff (for very good reasons: see below).","Without proper training, you are expected to know what to do plus understand the workplace jargon (rumble, face-up, backstock, overs, brown-box etc). This includes use of warehouse tools and equipment and H&S rules for warehouse are not given!

You are not encouraged or complimented for your hard work. It is likely you will be given no progression. All statements on B&M's ""working for us"" web page are not true and progression is only ever offered when managers leave due to the conditions. 

Managers moan about and insult staff, particularly new ones, in warehouse together behind said coworker's back.

Managers take as many cigarette breaks as they like and sit around drinking coffee or typing away on their phones whilst all staff are busy. Certainly no understanding of ""lead by example"" and cannot commit to hard working themselves. Easy to blame staff for mistakes.

Very bad management. Store managers use abusive, intimidating language to subdue, devalue and demoralise each employee. Almost always done to everyone at the same time in the warehouse.

Very stressful environment surrounded by drama. Constant feud between day and night staff;  both alienated by disinterested management team. Every man for himself attitude.

Poor training: 2 of the 4 hours of introductory day spent signing documents and hijacking the word ""training"" by instead being given a questionnaire and a manual to read for the answers - including H&S regulations! 

Health and safety regulations commonly ignored. 

Store managers act aggressive and implies job loss if you vocalise your in-work concerns.

Management make it clear CCTV is ""carefully monitored to keep watch on staff"" or reviewed the day after.

Your hard work will never be appreciated. You will be reminded that you are easily replaceable by ""just a phone call to the Jobcentre"".

Warehouse is untidy, unsafe, poses H&S risks in all directions, and you are expected to use equipment with no prior training or without wearing the proper equipment. 

You will likely be given a 12-hour contract but to abide the contract you cannot accept a second job to ensure you retain availability. Most weeks you will be working 28+. However, remember, you will never know which week when your hours will go down to your minimum. 

Rotas changed often, almost always without notice. Nor will the amended rota be put up on the staff noticeboards. Mostly, hours are taken away from you.

If you agree to a low-hour contract and the availability clause, you will lose your job by taking a second. I have witnessed this myself by two other General Assistants.

Supervisors and managers are paid only a few pence more than GAs.

All of this, plus stress, plus poor working conditions, plus constant mental wellbeing concerns, for only £7.20 per hour (NMW)"

4. Those who volunteer to work 6 days will still get lousy roadshows.
5. So obvious bias on roadshows...certain individual always gets the best roadshows. Obviously because of personal relationship - best friends....but those with real authority also doesn't care.
6. Leaders need to go to roadshows, sometimes whole day during many weekends for past 8-10 months. Sacrifice of more family time even when we work till late every day.

- Hiring : I've received a beautiful and sneaky lie from a hiring person saying that "" pretty much everybody reaches its target quite easily"", when I had serious doubts about that points when asking friends at Oracle on the hiring period...
- Training budgets and versions were and still are too much, you eat Oracle, sleep with it, dream of it, stress about it, and even hang out with it... Incredible brainwashing machine that reminded me of a Ford factory... many online training where people need real management and coaching  ...
Self service : first day I started the manager was late to welcome me, he threw a PC at my face and didn't say anything, left me by my own in there until end of day, you have to ask people and order everything yourself (phone, keyboard, mouse) Imagine you are man versus Oracle processes, partners, approvals and above all that you have to sell... sometimes you spend more time internally to convince people than to sell ...
- Management : I've never seen a line of managers that inspire such a little amount of motivation and dedication to work, when you work for Oracle in apps, you work mostly for your basic salary and because you are assimilated to a state employee in a government company, Ministery of IT. Change is very slow for anything. Managers are there to give instructions never to inspire to action, they give disproportionate targets compared with what can really be achieved. Else, with a normal company you define a real strategy to follow after few successes to make successes more regular and automatic, with Oracle nope, you swim your way all the time. 
- HR: they protect company interests only 
- Pricing : pricing à are incredibly high for SMB market, up to 90% discounts rates can be asked and approved. Seriously ??? Is this a pricing  strategy guys ? 
- Partners : they can refuse at delivery points and screw the work you led during months and months, because They are in a stronger position (I don't know what partner managers are really doing ??) they are not too many and can be not well trained for implementations, so not that great to be successful and get the first references and testimonies (early adopters) 
- Admin hassle : i think you can reach a burn out if you spend 3 months in admin hassle with Oracle, I don't wish that for an enemy, worst approval system ever, very suitable for big companies deals and long processes but not to be reactive and competitive in SMB market...
- Product : products are well designed and engineered together very good but they look ugly and from another planet, it can't be competitive with niche players, very often beaten, so the plateform speech works mostly with big players not SMB, see guys ??! Start small will a beautifully designed small product and expand - people buy with emotions not with logic, especially small companies.
- Meritocracy : almost absent lol. Some people can sign because they have the good accounts/ receives opportunities, some people succeed because their partners do everything for them, some people succeed because their managers do everything for them. And above that you have the privilege to see their names and pictures in end of quarters presentation as successful people! 
-Salaries : huge disparities between people, some are IC1 / 2/3 and we don't even know why ?? Especially new hires.
- Gratitude : I didn't see it that much, Oracle has a financial logic in a Sales department, we are figures and numbers mostly, it's like football you are punished if you don't score, but they never tell their part of responsibility in the equation, it reminds me of a dictature. Ahhhh sorry, they give you a mug written 1 year / 2 years in it after a year or two of sweat, how cute and wonderful !!!!
It's many ingredients to not succeed out there that made me take a choice to get out from there.
I was about to hire people that I know to earn an extra commission but I didn't do it even if I don't know them..."

This is a high turnover company.  Account Executives are constantly in and out with no way to move internally. 

In  the last year I have seen 6 very skilled sales people leave due to high quotas, poor leadership, and not being able to move up in the org. Every team from time to time will have a ""plus one"" on their team. This person is there to help the team while another person is put on plan for not hitting their quota. While this is set up to be a learning role it ends up being a reminder that someone is there to take your spot at anytime. 

Account Executives did make a lot of money when quotas were attainable, but with the Microsoft Acquisition quotas went up  and more people were hired. This created less opportunity for everyone and it doesn't look to be slowing down.  

The Role: 
This role is a Sales Development role primarily. You will spend most of your day prospecting out of an excel doc. 

The sales process is easy. The tools sell themselves and you just need to find the people who can afford this solution. 

Leadership: 
There is a a lot of time put in to learning and developing. If you are lucky to have a manager who has been here a while you will get a great learning experience. If you have a new manager this is going to be much harder. Most of the people who have left have had new managers who weren't properly trained to develop people or work with them.

The Right Fit: 
Currently in Sales Development or SMB sales and killing it. You are used to a high quota and a transactional sale. Maybe you have some customer service experience as well.

The outsourcing of IT support a couple of years ago is a disaster: they can handle something simple like creating an email account ... but anything more complex gets bounced from team to team and tends to disappear in the ether.

The forthcoming of outsourcing of further IT teams to Tech Mahindra via TUPE is a risky strategy that is likely to be detrimental to the company over time.  

However well the handover of knowledge - about the complex data content & software solutions handled by these IT systems - is handled between dedicated long-term staff and their Bangalore replacements, this is no substitute for the in-depth knowledge & experience of the existing staff, some of whom have been with the company for decades.  

The real risk comes when those Bangalore replacements leave after a few years for a higher salary elsewhere and some of the previous knowledge share is not passed on to their successors.

To thrive here and achieve success in terms of promotion, moving up roles, moving up in levels you need one of the following.
1. Be a relative, friend, neighbor, family close to any of LT folks Delivery manger, Service practice leader, Director.
2. Be a diversity.
If you are very hard working, politically right, not direct, flexible, intelligent and be innocent, you may have some success but not guaranteed.","1. MS IGD is a private run tight knit group. The LT team has no backbone. They will never standup for their subordinates. This is very true especially in the middle management. Be it the Technical delivery mangers, delivery managers or practice directors.
a. Once you approach them with a problem, you will looked at against company, not have flexible mindset, problem creator. They won’t speak up or try to solve your problem by arguing for what is right, because they don’t want to offend their peers or managers.
b. They bring their own people, friends and families. They want to keep promoting their ALs. I suppose you understand what AL means.
c. They are incorrect collaborators in suit and coat. Most of the folks have been somehow caught warned when trying to take advantage of their diversity subordinate. 
d. They hires lot of machs and college interns. They spend on them taking them to parties. Why???? Because these people will give them good score in MS poll. This way they continue to exist. If these interns, college fresh hires wake up and stand for themselves, the workplace would be much better. They are the future citizens, and they should not get enticed by cheap money, alcohol and shut up. This is how our nation is being managed. Shut the young up and they realize things are out of control. This is how our country was ruled by keeping the young in the dark.
e. The internal job posting is one of the biggest joke. Do you know where you will be posting for job that is already filled in or taken? It’s an eye wash. Name sake they will interview.
2. Msigd Has Been Polluted By Former Msit People
a. There was a organization called GDCI a decade back. This was called as global delivery center India. It became msit later. This team was then merged back to idc later. Now around early 2008 - 2010 many employees copied the CEO, LT of msit, idc and mgsi and sent communication on the reality. These employees exposed how the local people abused other state people, how they promoted their own dna, family friends and built an empire.
b. When this information become wide spread, few people from msit started moving into igd. They started building the same people. This folks, mfs, took on positions like engagement managers, professional development and resource managers and practice leaders and directors.
c. They then converted igd like msit slowly.
3. Only ALs gets promoted, encouraged
a. Soon the same mf, LT folks encourage only people who will do al.
b. They will give 0 rating for people who speak up.
c. They will reprimand people who escalate on folks who are poor performers.
d. They will only encourage diversity colleagues that’s HR policy
All of us need to work 200% to make up for their diversity counterparts. I have also worked and managed many diversity who are real gems. Some of them colleagues are extremely talented, with high aspirations. But the other half need the pass to get promoted, get hike and survive.
4. Its NOT IDC
a. Unlike the lt in idc the lt in igd are non technical, sales, and non it managers who joined from other indian based service companies managing herds.
b. Idc lt is made up of talents similar to our CEO. They were once developers, program managers, product unit mangers and group managers. The mgsi, msgd, igd (multi named ms igd) have leadership who ever managers, team leads in companies like satyam, infosys, wipro, tcs. What can you expect?? 
c. The type of work in ms igd is that of pure consulting. Its about passing information from here and there, understanding customer, selling yourself and your team, lobbying ms products, delivery some solution to the customer. Unlike idc where there is lot of technical work, and hands on hard core development
Better together in this journey and better further from igd, Take care."

-Very useful experience with customers, clothes, fashion and dealing with an awful company.","-Management can be very rude and unfair.
-Management almost never act on problems staff bring to their attention.
-the work place conditions are quite bad I could literally go on forever about them.
-Nothing works.The tills are always freezing, the air conditioning is often broken and more however it wouldn't appear anything is ever done about any of it.
-overtime is very difficult to obtain in my store. This is a serious problem for many as the vast majority of staff only receive a 20 hour part time contract and full time (40 hours) is rare you are also never allowed to stay clocked in longer than 40 hours meaning that you may be asked to take an extra long break 1 day that week.
-The ugly uniform is only 33% cotton so combine that with the terrible air conditioning and you've got a serious sweat problem to deal with.
-The time you are clocked in is applied to your pay in stages of 15 minutes for each shift. So don't think you will be earning a penny more for clocking in 5 minutes early and leaving 3 minutes late at the end of your shift for example.
-No employee benefits and no discount except 10% for 2 weeks in December.
- the pay is absolutely terrible for the hard work every staff member and supervisor put in every day.
-Holiday is difficult to get and requires at least 4 weeks notice however try 6 months if you want a better chance of getting it."

563738,Microsoft,2010-04-17, General Manager,Current Employee,,4,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,v,x,o,Microsoft,Microsoft is pervasive in the industry across most segments.  This affords a lot of great opportunities to work on a diverse range of technologies.  You can work for a couple of years platform or tools and then shift to Azure or cloud computing -- few companies have this simultaneous breadth and depth.  Changing positions in the company is relatively easy.  At the company there are a number of opportunities to be involved in deloping products that you don't directly work on.  Most groups are flexible in terms of the hours/schedule that you work.  Most groups at Micosoft have a good work life balance (i.e. the days of death marches are largely over).  The benefits are excellent.,The high level company strategy in areas where Microsoft isn't being sucessful is in constant churn.  There is little reason to believe that Microsoft will start being succesful in areas where it is currently challenged.  Innovation at the company can be challenging as there are a number of vocal critics to new approaches.  Many of these critics have spent their entire careers working at Microsoft which limits their perspective.

Other then this nothing nice to write about this company as you’ll read below","Working 12 hour’s a day and being smirked at if you want to go home when your contracted hours are finished.

Check some of there Facebook reviews as well disgusting....

Back stabbing bully boy politics in the office, HR do not know what they are doing and literally employe all of the worst people society has who bought a suit out of Moss and think there something special. Aka Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belford off life Insurance .............. 

Micro management from day one and the old saying if your face don’t fit... a lot of dirty smells in the office as everyone got a brown nose.

Being treated like an animal when god for bid your ill or sick the most kind of deluded talk on the phone about losing your bonus and it doesn’t look good management want be impressed, Performance review is given for not calling before 830am!

The company has basically one rule screw the customer 7 ways from Sunday no literally... your first two weeks are some lame bs training and how great the company is and there is some black book that if you hit all the targets you’ll make 100k ... lol

As soon as your on the phone you have 7 numbers you can dial out from! Yes 7... as the title says if you don’t believe me go on there website and do a quote and see how many people call you from different numbers, basically that’s what you’ll be doing and if I’m honest it was a sick thing to do to old/ill venerable people I mean building your whole sales pitch around “why now” did you not love your kids before. If you died who was going to pay your mortgage and your funeral cost’s they are expensive why do you want to put your children through that grief etc. Then out of no where your asking for the clients Direct Debt details and boom! This company want be around for much longer as they have already had a failed business before in the past which the management love bragging about not paying off debts and staff and it want be long till they have it happen again, some of the tactics are now being investigated so not long before trading standards to walk in

Another little know fact is the company never sacks anyone people end up leaving as they cannot take it any more. Your forced to work pretty much every single weekend. Again they say in the interview no weekends! But call on Saturday and Sunday or better yet do a quote lol it’s all about hitting unrealistic targets so if you want to work nearly 85 hours a week for about 40k per year, even that is unrealistic but then yeah go for it.

It works out to be less the £10 an hour, I’m sure I sure a job application for the high street in basingstoke for £8 or £9 an hour lol at least the people you work with there aren’t all back stabbers and degenerates. Holiday at this company is a joke as well dear god I nearly forgot you have to book holiday in 2 weeks notice which is fare enough but and worst off all you have to take 7/8 days compulsory in December due to the office being shut

Proof is in the pudding call the company and find out what there really like for your self, also call on a Saturday or Sunday and ask the agent why are you working on days your company’s doesn’t even state it is open!"

1. If you thought EastEnders is full of drama, then you should see this place. This place is for people who enjoy drama. Expect to be walked-over by the some staff members for absolute no reason. Thinking of retaliating? Think twice! If you retaliate and you are not liked by certain individuals within the business, then you are done for.

2. There were not any job opportunities within the last 12 months and there will most likely not be any coming up anytime soon. You are only allowed to progress if you are liked by the certain individuals and if you pretend to get along with the majority of the stakeholders. On top of that, the job opportunities are very meaningless, you are in a dead-end job after all.

3. The salary is worse than what you can get by working in retail and do not expect a good bonus at the end of the financial year. You will make more money selling hats to a hat-maker than what you will make with Barclays.

4. The systems crash every other day and you are expected to get on with any other outstanding work in the meantime.

There are people who are queueing for a position here and some, if not the majority, of these people will enjoy working here. However, if you are not the average person (who will most likely find my review very negative), then think about whether you really want to work here. I have worked in 3 business functions within Barclays in the last few years and I must tell you that only about 20% of the stakeholders actually enjoy their jobs. The other 80% absolutely hate everything about their jobs and about themselves. Do you want to be surrounded by a majority of people who hate themselves, and subsequently hate you, or you do you want to be around people who celebrate you? That is your choice."

Also liaise with law enforcement, fire, and medical agencies. You really get a chance to challenge your communication skills and last-moment critical decision-making skills in a stressful situations at times which I think is good. My current direct supervisor is a good supervisor which is why I rated this 4-stars, I otherwise would have rated in 3-stars. You also get a cafeteria with decent food at times and it's free, 401k w/ matching plan, medical,dental, and vision. HR is very nice and helpful whenever you need anything.","Working in security a lot of times you will have to do things that are not in your job description. For example, sometimes you would have to take up luggage for guests because bellmen have all gone home or are not available. You would have to take care of shipping and handling department if they are not here, such as checking to see you a package is in for a guest, delivering the package, or signing in packages from carriers. You would also be asked to deliver misc. items such as (keys, mail, etc) to guests in their rooms. if you work graveyard you would assume all housekeeping duties, have to learn how to make a bed the hotel way, deliver toothbrushes, toothpaste, towels, etc. Also learn how to deliver something as big as a fridge or roll-away bed to a room. And if the fridge is dirty, you would have to clean it. Pay is low considering you have to assume a lot of other responsibilities. Don't get me wrong, I love helping people but don't give me tasks like it's my ACTUAL job when you can just hire more housekeepers, bellman, deliveryman etc. You also hand out keys and radios everyday to employees coming in and receiving keys and radios from employees coming out, kind of like a ""professional key keeper"". So rather than a security officer actively monitoring security cameras, looking for hotel safety issues, making critical decisions in stressful emergency situations, communicate with people to de-escalate situations, which is the reason why I'm into the security field, you're basically a security officer only when they need you. Don't get me wrong, you still do those stuff ON THE OCCASION. Other than that you're more like someone who just does things nobody in the hotel wants to do or is too lazy to do."

People are encouraged to serve their self interests instead of what’s best for the company or consumer.  In order to get promoted, you need to launch something impactful.  Sounds valid right?  No, because once something launches people move on to the next big thing instead of maintaining the product.

As such, people who are rude, sexist, unpleasant and not team players get promoted.  One of the Sr product managers drives his roadmap entirely based on what will get attention from marketing or in the press, so instead of building for everyone, we build based on what new idea marketing has.  On top of that, he had had multiple complaints filed against him be women, and has faced no disciplinary action.

Also, this is one place where you are constantly told to “stay in your lane”.  I’ve never worked anywhere where trying to fill gaps in for the team have repeatedly been not only discouraged, but dinged for.  And the justification is always “it won’t help your perf.”  Meaning that I can’t get raises, bonuses or promotions because I’m doing something off my official job description.

The people here are entitled and when there’s a poor performer, instead of taking care of the problem, they just shuffle them into another team.  It’s like the Catholic Church.

Yeah the free food and perks are great, but it’s been a hostile work environment from day 1."

But then again, it is not going so great with the company, there is hardly any vision or innovation, so the safest thing to do is to cut back on your supporting staff and outsource the lot. Combined with (hostile) take overs it is the way you can still show growth in the numbers each year. Since MH was on board people got layed off in no time (26k this FY alone).

We are constantly having to run around trying to do many jobs at once.

A customer asked me to wipe a table as every table was dirty, i had left food  cooking in the kitchen and i had to apologise because i couldnt do it .. i have always prided myself on putting the customer first but in that situation you havent the tools to do that.

Before staff cuts it was a nice job... they have however taken on staff for christmas but still on weekends the cafe relies on staff from other departments to support it.. but they are limited in what they can do as they dont have training in cafe.
Another point is that m&s customers are challenging... they expect a lot which is understandable considering what they pay in store, but with the issues above it means we the staff receive so much negativity from customers and sometimes it can get to you.

- Friendly colleagues from all over the world.","- You can’t be yourself. If you're different, they may just ditch you or say you don’t pay attention or aren’t enthusiastic enough - even though your performance shows otherwise.
Instead, they expect you to join their herd of sheep >> develop a fake smile, kiss up everybody and absolutely adore everything the company does - basically adopt their robotic mentality and forget about your common sense. I actually don't know why they just don't use bots for their customer service as when you communicate with customers, you're forced to use their templates that often don't make sense and sound silly and are so obviously just copied and pasted when customers read the response.

- Dishonesty. Before you join the company, they reassure everyone they don’t care about quantity but quality but then it's all about targets. I think they could be honest about it from the beginning as there's no reason to lie about that but I guess their pretentiousness won't allow it.

- Incompetent team leaders who play favourites and who often only became team leaders because of that and because they’d been working for the company for years. They keep repeating their nonsense even if you prove them wrong as they automatically think they know everything better than you just because they’d been with the company for longer. However, I must say there are also some nice and relaxed team leaders, you just need to be lucky to get allocated to the good ones.

- The information you’re given is inconsistent - when you ask about something, everyone will give you a different answer all the time.

- Don’t you dare going to the toilet when not on a break or logging in to your computer 10 seconds late.

- They say everyone makes mistakes and that’s how you learn. However, if you make a mistake, they suddenly forget about how you were before and never give you a chance to improve yourself as they will immediately put you on their blacklist and forever use the one thing you once did wrong against you.

- They watch you all the time, every single thing you do is monitored.

- The company doesn’t care about their employees who are just numbers to them. They can fire anyone they want at anytime and quickly find a replacement.

- Super short lunch breaks - 30 minutes is barely enough, would prefer having a 40 minute lunch and the other two 15 minute breaks to be just 10."

The staff I work with are great, including the managers, though obviously this could vary tremendously between stores and regions.
I'm never really bored at work. Angry, tired, happy... Sure, but never bored.","The rota can be an nightmare. Your shifts can vary so wildly from week to week that your sleep and social life will most definitely suffer. If you're a particularly social person and enjoy regular weekends out and being with friends you should forget about the job right now because I haven't had a weekend off in months. One morning you're up at 3am, the next you're not on until 2pm and so on... Basically it's very hard to have any kind of regularity in your free time because the rotas are so varied and inconsistent. 

There's also a lot of variation in the way staff are treated. The gents are expected to do more heavy lifting, more physical work and that's fine, sure, but they're also typically the last people to get the time off that they want. In my store it's all too easy for a girl to bat her eyelids and get whatever time off she likes. Likewise certain members of staff seem to get away with murder. They perpetually under perform (making more work for the rest) without any repercussions. 

There really isn't that much room for advancement. At best, after many years of thankless grafting you can make your way to store manager. The money at that level is good, yes, but in return you basically have to live in the store. If you've any ambition to make it into upper management you need to reconsider because there is no opportunity for store employees to advance to that level. They would rather employ people straight out of university.

My last little gripe is the uniform. The clothes are fine and good but men have to be clean shaven. This might not bother you at all but to me seems antiquated and discriminatory at best. There's no hygiene basis for it whatsoever. You are allowed facial hair for religious reasons though, which is almost more insulting. Beards are okay, basically, as long as you're the right race and skin colour."

CBRE is the best commercial real estate company in the world. If you are interested in commercial real estate this is the place you want to be.

2. Company has been around for over 100 years, so its easily the most stable big real estate company. Paychecks are reliable. 

3. The companies revenue growth since the Trammell Crow acquisition has been huge. The current CEO Bob and his leadership team have been instrumental in moving the company within striking distance of the Fortune 100. Can't argue with results like that.

4. The Seattle and NYC technology product development teams are easily some of the most capable and talented people I have ever worked with.","For context I worked in the Digital and Technology / IT division; CBRE is huge so experiences will vary a lot by job role and location.

1. Over the last five years or so the D&T division was globally built up rapidly with limited planning or coordination with the wider company. Many but not all projects started with good intentions but lost focus on our users needs and have extremely low adoption as a result. Because of the high cost of investment the rest of the company is not happy with the results and everyone knows it. This has created a culture in D&T of extreme top down micromanagement that make it nearly impossible to make progress on customer outcomes due to constantly shifting priorities. The leadership is now scrambling to adapt and is not willing to take feedback from teams on the ground.

2. My former department was split between New York City and Seattle and collectively built some of the most highly adopted and well liked user centered technology products in the CBRE. In the last year a new set of D&T middle management came in and laid off half the department and outsourced work to a team of contractors in India. This was all before Covid19. Over the next nine months another 25% of the team left voluntarily (including me), because the new middle management team has been making decisions about product direction and team staffing that are so far in the wrong direction that our best option was to find new jobs during a pandemic induced recession. Now the team is wildly understaffed and the same middle management team that made all these decisions are shocked the team is struggling to produce and has low moral. And I felt like they were blaming our department for that outcome."

This offer for the job was obviously not communicated to the store as I had to contact them myself and they had no record of my interview and offer. Long story short had to have another interview!
- Standing up for hours on end, not allowed to bring water in
- Poor wages and paid incorrectly
- Management constantly watch you and comment on your service after every customer
- Even if its your first job management assume you know everything without real training
- Hours were not set and changed every week or last minute
- Hours applied for change, I started with 16 hours which eventually went down to 8 hours. Saw this happen to a lot of full time staff who needed the hours desperately.
- Made to ask every customer to buy more products and even ask for their postcodes
- Dealing with terrible customers but that's typical of all retail
- 'Forgetting' to give proper breaks especially if you are under 18 they will use this to their advantage (I once worked a 9 hour shift and only got 15 mins, little did I know this is illegal)
- Lots of people quitting and finding opportunities elsewhere which shows how bad the company is
- Even though the store was new the equipment was outdated
- No set department for employees, I applied to be a cashier but spend more time in the warehouse, repricing or on shop floor
- Managers sitting around chatting about employees but you get told off if you talk to one another or wait for customers

Overall just very poorly organised everyone couldn't wait to leave and I am so glad I quit. If I was being paid more than £3.79 an hour I would have stayed but for that low pay it was not worth the stress. It wasn't until I found a new job I realised how horrible a place it was to work."

Today's GT is different; the make up of the leadership is ex Anderson partners that could not find a job at big 4 after collapse of Anderson.  These partners are now in leadership roles and are trying to get as much cash as possible from the firm to make up for their loses.  They are not forward thinking leaders that posses values and are not looking for best interest of the firm and the employees.  They are individuals that are just looking to fill their pockets at any cost.  The leadership is reactive and constantly changes directions.  Line partners are primarily not happy and are not doing anything since they are too scared of the leadership and in a lot of cases they don't care about anything other than their paycheck.  

The firm is loosing its top talent from partners to managers to seniors.  Looking at the tenure of average employee you will find that majority of people are fairly new to the firm.  The firm has become a revolving door.   There are very few partners left who you can look up to and respect.  The inability of the firm to hire develop and retain top talent and constant turnover is causing a lot of service delivery issues with the client and regulator issues.  The service that the clients are getting is usually inferior to Big 4, midsize firms and local firms.  The firm is a highly bureaucratic institution with little transparency to employees and negative partner growth where partners do not care about the people and in a lot of cases they don't even care about the clients."

High pay, good benefits. There are still some very intelligent folks working there, but see below about the departure of the real talent.","I had fourteen managers within twenty months. Some of those managers I never even met face to face. Most managers only manage upwards, don’t expect any useful advice from your manager. In eight years I may have had one or two managers who had a clue how to manage, both of them were chased away. Negative reinforcement is not a good management technique and drives away intelligent employees. 

The sales reps I worked with were mostly clueless with a few exceptions. Sales managers simply barked at those reps, causing the reps who needed coaching to flail and then fail. I cannot tell you how many sales forecast calls I was on where the managers just berated their sales reps. No help just a beat down. Most sales reps have no idea what their products do, nor do they understand how to sell them. 

I spent eight years at Oracle, never got a pay raise despite service above and beyond the call of duty. A friend who was a manager said that is normal. You are expected to move jobs annually to make more money. 

You must keep track of what you do in fifteen minute intervals in multiple tools. The administrative overhead is really bad. 

Training is a joke, you only get the marketing slide decks, never get a chance to really use the technology you sell. 

Your customers will hate you because the rep before you may have done an audit to them and raped them so they can get a big pay check on the way out the door. 

Lots of arrogant colleagues that care nothing about their customers or coworkers makes this a very challenging place to work. Very cut throat unhealthy workplace. 

The work - life balance at Oracle is a joke. Burnout is rampant. I had two colleagues leave and rather than hire replacements, I was asked to take up the slack, for a year and a half. All major account executives (CADs) are divorced, in the process of getting a divorce, or are terminally single due to their personalities. 

I know I have just written a lot of negative things about Oracle, but I tried very hard to make it work. After eight years worth of honest effort on my part, it was a frustrating experience. My customers loved me, and were shocked when I left, but they all watched what I described happen and all of them understand how hard I tried to make it work. They are happy to work with me again, for another vendor."

I work with a team that benefits from this greatly.  Each of us works from home one day a week.  It is the same day so we can plan around it.  Each team takes a different slant on myRyan so they can design what works for them (not be told what works and forced in to it).  For individuals who aren't producing results, they may not get this employee benefit and may have to report to the office every day.   

The pay is unmatched in the marketplace with unlimited earning potential.  Again, this is based on results of the team but, if the team does good work, hustles, and is entrepreneurial (meaning they can make it on their own; don't need to be spoon fed), then the pay exceeds industry standards.  I like to write my own destiny and be control of the earnings potential, which has been very rewarding.","There are growing pains but that is expected.

show up and leave whenever you like, never have to do a full days work","I can honestly say YNAP was one of, if not the worst experience of my professional life.
whether it be the rapid loss of skills I experienced whilst trying to work with *really* poorly implemented tech solutions by engineers who have never attempted to implement something before, or any understanding of what problem said solution is there to solve. Managers who haven't considered ""why"" when choosing a solution and ""who"" when choosing someone to implement said solution.

You will find that YNAP have almost all the tools you could possibly need, all implemented on top of one another. Except you can't configure them to suit your needs. You'll need to work with something that someone else has implemented with no experience and no exposure to the data you are working with or any willingness to listen to why you want to alter it, or the benefits it can bring.
You'll experience a culture where contractors are treated as untouchable and have built systems in a manner which keep them in a job. Contractors who can happily refuse to carry out tasks they don't consider valuable use of their time or the direction they want to go in. One time I was pulled into a room and asked to justify my position (to a contractor)

I experienced an extremely toxic culture whilst i was there, where every little thing was reported to management, who left me to rot in a corner to the point i essentially shut down by the end of my tenure. I had to take time off ill with stress with bullying and emotional torture common place if you don't fit the bill of who they want.  in my times confiding with other people from different departments, it was reiterated to me time and time again that the experience I was going through was not uncommon around the business.

Their tech stack is just awful! Time after time, I found myself constantly shaking my head in disbelief as I witnessed manually updating files in place on cloud systems, with no version control or audit trail or notification pipelines. Automation tools exist but they are bypassed regularly. IT Security is almost non-existant, with a blanket level of either prod or non-prod access and no granularity beyond that. If you take IT security seriously, this is definitely not the place for you.

There was zero social budget or training budget, I had to open my personal Online Training account up to one of my team, because the level of AWS knowledge was so low in the department and I was refused any budget to enroll him onto Pluralsight or Linux Academy"

It is a comfortable big company with good pay. You'll have decent work-life balance most of the time (again that can vary from group to group).","As an SDE at Microsoft, above average smarts are not really going to take you anywhere. You might end up in a group doing something cool and cutting edge, but your career trajectory and compensation are going to be the same as folks in some mediocre group elsewhere in the company. That can kill motivation over time. Microsoft has become too big and unlike the 90s it is no longer the most preferred tech employer. They no longer get the ""best and the brightest"".

424237,J-P-Morgan,2019-03-05, Devops Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",,3,,,,,,,o,o,o,Typical corporate job,"JPMC is a massive company with so many different areas that you can't keep track of them.  Working in technology is one area can be very different than another area.  I was in an older area that the company had little interest in doing anything with more than simply keeping them running.  So my opinion won't apply to everywhere. 

Pros:
The pay is very good. Generally it can be at the upper end of tech salaries if you have the experience.  But you have to fit in with the manager.  Really, your manager is the only management you'll ever deal with.  Get a good one and life is easy, get a bad one and you'll be miserable.  Movement within the company only happens if you can get in with the manager doing the hiring.  Its all about ""relationships"".  The jobs are stable for the most part, though quiet, small layoffs happen every so often.  They just don't talk about it.  There are bonuses, and they can be great, but once again it depends on your manager.  Mine was fantastic and gave me great bonuses each year.  Other managers hold that above their employees head whenever there is an issue, and then they'll give out really small ones.  I got about a 10% bonus.  But I spoke to another employee who was being threatened by his manager all the time with his bonus and ended up getting maybe a 3% bonus.  I convinced him to look for another job.  

Another pro is that the company is very diverse.   That's a big initiative and generally works well.

Its not hard to get a job here.  That can be good and bad.","The biggest issue with the company is the management churn.  My manager had three or four different managers over the course of two years.  It makes starting and finishing projects and long-term initiatives very difficult.  You'd think that managers would pick up where the last one left off, but that's not the case.  Each manager is a silo.  As your go further up the chain, the churn gets worse.  Its not that they necessarily leave, its that they move around.  I think they worst effect is that people are not invested in their area because they know they'll leave eventually.  That means that lower-level managers are the only ones who really work in the trenches.  Talking to them is really depressing.  They know any good initiative has a 50/50 chance of fizzing out.

Siloing exists and is terrible.  Managers are not accountable to one another for the most part.  Upper management doesn't resolve issues between them, nor do they care.  There is no cohesive chain-of-command.  Its very loose and whoever is the most charismatic and clever gets the job done.

HR.  We have an HR?  No, we don't.  Who's my HR person?  I have no idea.  There's someone, somewhere.  Probably not at my location.  Never met a single person in HR when I was hired, nor since.  The internal website is the closest thing I have to HR.

The talent pool is atrocious.  People who have no business in technology are here.  Offshore talent is terrible.  Developers who can barely code get jobs pretty easily.  Why, you ask?  Poor managers, sure, but mostly terrible, terrible recruiting.  Horrifically bad.  Their ""recruiters"" are offshore talent that have no idea about the job or the location.  They can't schedule things properly, and they can't talk to the candidate properly.  Candidate wants to know where to park?  Forget it.  Directions?  Might as well Google it.  Properly scheduled video conferencing room for an interview?  Good luck even getting a room that has a phone.  The recruiters sometimes get a little belligerent.  Decent talent walks away almost immediately.  Good talent doesn't even bother to apply.  And then onboarding takes months.  Employees show up sometimes without having any sort of equipment on the first day.  JPMC got rid of all the Administrative Assistants, so no one has any idea of who to talk to or what to do or where to go.  Its all handled by some ethereal system in the background.  Want to feel like a cog in the machine?  Work here.  If you're the only team member at your location, then you'll sit there and stare at your cubicle walls for days while things may or may be happening.  If there's an issue, there is little notice and even less done.  It takes individuals who actively chase after things to get someone onboarded.  Hiring someone is utterly embarrassing.  My team has had two people leave almost immediately.

Company culture is fake and empty.  Sure there are lots of initiatives and events and videos and training, but its devoid of real caring.  Its all about optics.  They got rid of the long term people that run the various locations, so the replacements are churners who don't care about making a cohesive group.  Its like a commuter workplace.  People come and go.  Upper management smiles a lot.  The good ones move on quickly.  Pounding sand is the number one activity at Chase.

Morale sucks.  Everyone knows the above issues.  And I had it easier than most.  People put on a fake a smile and try to make things work, but inside they're slowly dying.

But hey, the pay is good, the benefits are decent, and your job is pretty safe.   There's something to be said about not living in poverty.  We often take that for granted."

Paid time-off was excellent in states that prohibit use-it-or-lose-it policies.

The salary was fine, but I was underpaid for my skillset and talent.","Like many companies, Sage has embraced the open plan office. Like many technology companies, Sage has embraced Agile development processes. Sage uses one of the more popular Agile development processes called Scrum which involves seemingly endless social interactions that constantly interrupt one’s thought process.

Like many people with social anxiety disorder, I found this work environment and the culture that developed around it extremely stressful. I will not go into the details, but eventually I suffered psychotic depression. An unpleasant experience to say the least.

I recently settled a discrimination complaint that I brought through California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). The complaint was cross filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The terms of this settlement mean that the merits of the complaint are undetermined by the regulators and Sage doesn’t admit to any violations. As part of the settlement, the company is required to train all California management level employees regarding disability discrimination and requirements of initiating an interactive process to explore reasonable accommodation. In addition, they are required to put up some posters describing California’s discrimination protections. I also received a lump sum."

There are free snacks (but not meals, unless you count breakfast at 6AM and dinner after 8PM - I kid you not).

The money is good (before tax!) and there are yearly pay reviews which can be generous if you're fortunate enough to have helped the company out in some way (like fix a disastrous outage) or are especially sycophantic.","Bloomberg is a big company organised into product silos and where you land will make all the difference to your experience (hence the polarity of opinion here).

You may or may not end up with an idiot for a team leader, you may find yourself working on proprietary systems, completely isolated from industry standards, business practices and protocols, you might be working in a team with no social cohesion whatsoever.

And things can change radically overnight.  The team whose company you do enjoy might need you to work on another project in another team or the boss with whom you have a good working relationship might suddenly move back to the US and a clueless, dogmatic, despotic, company-man appear in his place.

The hours are long and you will find plenty of colleagues, bereft of social lives, who will show you up by arriving early and leaving long after you go home.  Although you will be contractually obliged to work 9 hours per day, expect to consistently work at least 10, many work 12 hours or more.

You might work there for years and never have anything challenging or important to work on.  There is a company policy known as keeping-the-lights-on which translates to if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it meaning the rate of development progress can be slow as molasses.  This is especially frustrating and can be soul destroying for the creatively minded.

Technologically, Bloomberg is incapacitated by decisions made decades ago and its terror of losing market share is tangible.  This manifests as the front-end looking like something from the 1980s but, worse still, developers are forced to use company-specific versions of tools and programming languages, meaning they will not be able to keep up-to-date with modern versions and practices which is poison for career programmers.  It lacks effective testing frameworks and the majority of teams are required to develop, test and release everything themselves, at their own peril.  Some teams do have dedicated roles for QA and deployment but there's no company-wide policy.

Expect to be called regularly at weekends and unceremoniously at 2AM because the network undergoes maintenance every day and anything consuming tick data will set off alarms when it stops arriving.

Promotion to positions of authority is patently based on the Peter Principle and micromanagement and an absolutely obsessive focus on negativity are the norm.  It's well known that the Team Leaders and managers often form cabals so just one of them not liking you could spell game over for your position at the company.  If this happens,  get out before they fire you, and they will - you have been warned."

* Product is in healthcare, so you feel you're doing something good
* The angry emails from the CEO asking why isn't anyone working unpaid overtime provide some comic relief","* Below-average salary, and above-average workload
* no benefits and no review process, even though reviews have been promised for over a year.
* the highest turnover rate I've ever seen:
within six months three of the most senior managers have left.
A year on, out of around 20 people I knew who worked in the technology team, only 3 or 4 were still with the company. Only one or two of them counted their experience at Babylon as positive.
* The company does the most egregious use of temporary contractors and offshore development (both India and Ukraine) that I've ever encountered.

But all these  pale in comparison to the CEO, Ali. Ali *is* Babylon. The company is like a creepy cult run by this man. 
Babylon is HIS company, and you're constantly reminded of that.
He will override any and all decisions that he's unhappy with (actual examples: 
team says project will take X weeks to complete. Ali says 'you have X/2 weeks'. Project is completed in X+5 weeks.
The design team says the app's background should be purple. Ali says the background  should be green. 
The list goes on)

Your status and influence in the court of Babylon are determined by how much the great leader likes you. 
Thus we have more than one senior manager who are completely clueless / incompetent about anything to do with their department, but are old friends of Ali's, or are great at taking credit for other people's work, so they get to have titles and influence, regardless of their glaring incompetence.

The culture of arbitrary, senseless, dictatorial decision-making flows downwards from the head, leading to projects being hastily started, frantically worked on, and suddenly dropped at the whim of the head honcho, or as a result of political power struggles inside the junta.

The great leadership tries to compensate for the great waste created by the mangement's incompetence by expecting employees to work more hours, for no extra pay (""a few weeks of engineering can save hours of planning"" seems to be the motto)."

People who get upset and ask for a manager are given to you. If they still don't feel your responses for sufficient you can transfer them to the next ""manager"".

Uploading documents that are already in digital format are converted to a format that loses much of the original clarity, so we ask the client for the document again and again.

If you live in the Puget Sound area (namely Seattle), are Software professional, and want to work for a Software company, there are few alternatives.  The software business of the Puget Sound is Microsoft.  Microsoft offers the most career choices, the most opportunities, the best benefits... in the Puget Sound area.  Compared to the Silicon Valley companies, Microsoft is decidedly average, but the Puget Sound area is not Silicon Valley.  Microsoft does employ some of the world's brightest people, and the line of applicants at its door is looong, but the brightest people don't make for the world's best company.","I was forewarned on my very first day:  beware of politics.  Microsoft is politics.  Every decision is a political decision.  Everyone treads lightly for fear of lawsuits.  The unofficial company motto might be: ""Do The Right Thing"" (TM), but --in truth-- it's more of a ""For the Love of Bill, Whatever You Do, Don't Do The Wrong Thing.""  The decisions which do get made are the safe, conservative, politically correct, decisions.  Innovation is always constrained by the Big Fear:  the fear of lawsuits.  Every discussion seems to be chaperoned by somebody from LCA (Legal Compliance) and no matter how important you are, how smart you are, how right you might be, the LCA is more important, more right.  The very bright people (TM) employed by Microsoft are constantly hamstrung by lawyers, by the esprit d' conservatism, and by the egos of the million other bright people working there along side of them.  Microsoft is like the proverbial Old Boys Club:  everybody who is anybody has been there since the beginning of time.  To get your foot in the door at Microsoft is tough... to lose your job for any reason is even tougher... as long as you don't do The Wrong Thing.  It's easier to keep quiet, do your job, and not question things.  Questioning is definitely a Wrong Thing.  Especially if you haven't been at Microsoft since the beginning of time.  About 25% of people on the Redmond campus aren't even Microsoft employees:  they are contractors (aka:  ""Orange Badges"").  And Orange Badges, even if they otherwise qualify as Very Smart People"" are treated not like second-class citizens:  they are necessary and tolerated, but resented for their paychecks.  Orange Badges are supposed to do their job.  Otherwise they should act the part of a good butler:  silent, halpful, invisible."

Middle management staff telling you to hurry up when you have to ask to go to the toilet in a group chat of 500 people as you work from home. They are so rude and vile to everyone. The job itself is hideous. It’s a boring easy job which is fair enough but they don’t tell you that you just get abused on the phone 7 hours a day everyday. I’ve never experience mental health issues before since this job. You receive absolutely NO support and even if you ask for help or to solely do emails (as you have to do them as well as calls) they take you off calls for a few mins until the horrid middle management start pushing calls through again. I cannot stress enough how you should avoid to work for this company. Everyone I have spoken to who work for this company has had the exact same experience as me. It is not worth the minimum wage.

The seating infra doesn’t promote team culture; it’s kinda like call centres (everyone sitting in rows, instead of cubicles); makes collaboration difficult. 

The major reason for my bad experience is the team. I have seen colleagues from other teams who’ve been with JP for a long time (10+ years) and are satisfied. So it all depends on your luck. 
My (team-specific) list is as follows:
Bad colleagues who undermine you so that they look good in comparison
Management who only care about themselves and their image
Appraisals are based on the management’s perception rather than your work (sometimes of people who might’ve spoken to you maybe 2-3 times in the whole year)
Onshore management only care about getting their work done (even if you’re slogging in office for LONG hours)

The second goal is keep a large layer of middle management and administrative (HUNC's, High Unit No Client) partners on board.   Overall, the regional and national partners will ask the working stiffs (partners, directors, sr mgrs, etc..) in the local offices to take no pay raise and no bonus (effectively pay cut) but will themselves suffer no economic detriment.  In fact, many make more in down times due to lower cost structure (ie no spending and no salaries).  The next con is a lack of honesty and clarity in the promotion cycle.  Deloitte loves the old carrot and whip system.  Incredibly outdated.

Flexible work environment - not tied to a desk all day - can go outside/work at a Google Cafe, etc.
Lack of structure means can define own job & execute on what you think is important
Resume builder - Google looks great on your resume","Finance is a 2nd class function (at best) and in general has very limited power within the organization.  This can make it difficult to make a difference or even be heard outside of the org.  Often, those who succeed in finance are those that can please their business partners in Engineering/Product which can cause incredible conflicts of interest (sure, that acquisition looks fabulous and it's only $100M!  I can make an analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense.  This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong.

Finance is primarily full of investment bankers & consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience.  This causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don't understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it (seriously - within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we're moving to a monthly forecast view instead).  At first, I tried very hard to get more Corp Finance folks in the org but now I actually think IBankers do best as folks with actual CF experience tend to be so shocked by the Google processes (or lack thereof) they simply cannot hang.

Work/life balance is dreadful - since the employee base is generally young and former bankers, most folks don't seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families (or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work) this can be painful.  Especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere.

Google elects not to use ERP or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions.  Then they don't staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources.  Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be ""scrappy"" to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data.  Upside is that without a data source no one's likely to know if you're completely off base - but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions.

There are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at Google - particularly if you don't support the Search / Ads business.  Forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 Q to achieve.

This is a social/extroverted environment which means that those who are good at networking have an edge over those who don't, even if the folks who don't are doing a superior job.  I've taken advantage of it myself but it's not fair."

Management is understanding when you need time off for doctor appointments, etc.  Best health care plan of any company I've worked for. Company match 401k up to 6%.   There are good tuition reimbursement opportunities.  There are employee resource groups that you can get involved in.  Can get a third week of vacation in your second year.  Good place to get experience and looks good on resume.","Pay is well below standard, so negotiate as much as you can during initial salary negotiations.   Extremely difficult and time consuming to get a raise.  May qualify for a paltry merit increase of 1.5% every January if you perform great, but they delay it till July.  So that means that you only get half of that 1.5%.  It's a slap in the face to those workers that went above and beyond the previous year.  Career growth is extremely stagnated,  no mobility.  Making it worse is that there are many lame long termed employees that are extremely comfortable and dont want to leave.  Very difficult to get a promotion, they want you to do Superman type work for a long period of time to qualify, and even if you do get promoted the amount of raise in pay is well below standard.

For some reason the company makes it difficult to transfer to other groups.  It may take years and multiple tries to finally transfer, and when they do they dont give raises.

Feels like employees aren't truly valued by the company.  Treated more like a number.  Differential treatment between the business groups, even if they are under the same director and in the same office, leading to lower morale and jealousy. 

The work is very repetitive and monotone, which makes it tiresome and unfulfilling after some time."

269156,Facebook,2018-12-04, Talent Acquisition,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","London, England, England",1,1.0,3.0,,2.0,4.0,1.0,o,r,x,My honest opinion,"Amazing benefits, pay, environment, tools, stock and 0,1% of the people working there are actually cool. But don’t get it twisted! All the free food, snacks, drinks etc. are made to keep you at work longer :)","Looking back at my experience there, I can clearly see that I was unfortunate to end up in a team that I was in. The fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me, but having just moved to FB I didn’t think of leaving that early. Internally, people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team. I figured that’s the reason why they hired a complete new team, instead of just moving some people around. 
 
However, people at FB are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company.  They make themselves believe that they are happy, but in reality everyone is constantly anxious. They just learn to cope and make it feel normal. 

The pressure is HIGH and the workload tremendous. Because of the amount of silly meetings that you can’t say no to, you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed. Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn’t switch off). I knew of other colleages that they come in on a Saturday to do some extra work, and some dedicate their Sunday evening on projects to add to their internal CV. 
You can’t really switch off, at least not before 9PM. So, if you’re in a relationship/have kids, don’t go there. As a single person I felt bad for my colleagues with a family.

In my situation, and I also speak for the rest of the team, there was no support, no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were. It’s all very performance driven, so you have to Build up that amount of work you do, cause everything gets tracked. They don’t care how you do it, just do it. This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts. You will be compared to Peers on your level, so it’s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review. 

We had a new manager starting a few months after us, and hierarchy was the management style. Having anything to say went against the manager’s principles and clearly we weren’t liked. So were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager, because of their opinions. Be mindful of what you say...not everything is appreciated. 
At FB, managers are more valued than IC’s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good IC. So please be careful and try to make your manager your friend, trust me it will help you. 

They have amazing trainings on how to manage bias, but in all honesty, everyone was biased. The way they hired people, they way they treated people and the way they rated each other. During the annual performance cycle, you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus. 

Up until now, FB was the least favorable experience for me. I only say ‘worst experience’ when I talk to friends. They saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment. 

I do want to say that 2% genuinely loves working there, unfortunately the majority doesn’t."

Even though the company has gotten bigger and progressively more bureaucratic (perhaps unavoidable considering its growth), I do think that at heart they really want to continue to push the envelope.

My fellow Google employees were among the smartest and most creative people I've worked with.  Probably some of the most enthusiastic too.

Google has a lot of money, and they are able to provide their employees with a lot of perks and benefits that other companies can't afford.  Also very philanthropic. (Again, they have the money, so they can afford to be.)   They are extremely forward thinking, in terms of trying projects that don't directly relate to business.  

It's cool to try out new products that become part of your everyday life.  GMail and Google Docs among my favorites.","It's ridiculously hard to get hired at Google.  They place a premium value on your pedigree (education, GPA, even outside interests) rather than on your skills and ability to contribute on a practical level.  A Stanford grad with a 4.0 GPA doesn't automatically make a better employee than a UC grad.  Or even (gasp!) someone without a degree at all.

There's no career path, and no career planning.  I never had a good manager, much less a mentor, the entire time I was there.  The people who got promoted were the ones who kissed up and knew how to play the game.

Low salaries.  I know there are a lot of perks to ""make up for it,"" but I'd rather have the money and decide how to spend it myself.  Not being a new grad fresh out of college, I didn't care about the perks."

The buildings are clean. You can often get away with doing very little work if you know some tricks.,"I was made redundant on three separate occasions. My jobs were all fixed term contracts that were 'externally funded'. Just because you have a university contract does not mean you work for the university. Rather you work for the funding body and the university is just doing HR and providing office space. In my final two years there was not a single department meeting and only TWO office meetings. My manager was happy for people to work hard doing way more than their contracted hours but in five years he did not do one second more than his contact (he was always the first out of the door !).

There was an incident where my manager was unhappy with something I had put on a website. He sat just yards from my desk. Rather than say anything to me he went on holiday during with time I received a mysterious letter asking me to attend a meeting. No clue was given as to what this meeting was to be about. I emailed a more senior manager and she ignored the email. The meeting was a total ambush with a member of personnel there. I was given on opportunity to prepare my defence or have a union rep present. 

When it came time to renew contracts several hard working people were made redundant (this was verifiable via detailed time sheets) while people who had produced hardly any work were kept on because they were then manager's 'friends'. One person who did next to no work and got a new contract calibrated by drawing gratify all over the office walls ! This person (a man in his mid twenties) had previously made racist remarks to a co-worker however his father had two meetings with the dean after which it was decided he would have his contract renewed and didn't have to apologise. His manager said that he was 'amused' by the situation !"

501825,Mastercard,2016-09-21, Business Consultant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco, CA",5,3.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,4.0,v,v,v,Consulting with an analytical and software spin,"As a Business Consultant I get to work on multiple clients with multiple teams, so I have exposure to different industries, types of projects, and people to work with all the time. It makes every day have something new and keeps the challenges exciting and rewarding. There is a little bit a travel (1-2 times a month), so just enough to have different experiences but not so much that it takes over your life.

Within a year at APT I have had tremendous opportunity to work with executives of large companies, having even presented in person to CEOs and CFOs. There is a lot of growth opportunity and I can continually ask for specific type of work I might want to get involved with.

For the SF office in particular, the work space is relaxed and fun. We are still small enough where we really get to know each other and there are a lot of ways to be social with coworkers. We have office sponsored events several times a month in addition to the smaller more spontaneous hanging out.

In the end, I truly believe in what APT is trying to do as a company, and that makes the work so much more meaningful. We are a software firm, but we really think about how business people will interpret our analytics. We are a consulting firm, but our recommendations are based on data driven results. We build well rounded people who don't just do their job, but get involved in other parts of the company, from recruiting, to product development, to marketing, to culture building.","APT could improve its recruiting to widen its candidate pool. There are sometimes obvious gaps in diversity. Luckily, there are various efforts in the works to try and tackle this.

Not being in DC can sometimes be frustrating. We are increasingly growing as a global company and we need to think more about how to improve cross office communication, collaboration, and culture.

We are definitely not a 9-5 job (I would say 50-55 hours is the average), and there are some later nights and stressful situations. Usually if you're staying late, though, it's with your team and for an important reason so everyone feels motivated to get the job done. We also are compensated enough to make it worth it."

The Business Unit I work in and in particular the department I am in feels like a big family which really helps considering the amount of time you are at work and the pressures of the working day. They also they listen to their people, always asking for opinions on how they can do better and what they can offer us. Their recent attitude towards the Corona Virus has been about keeping their employees and customers safe and they have put this before their bank balance which lots of companies haven't. Whilst many of my colleagues were furloughed during this time, I carried on working and to see how the company have reacted in comparison to other builders is phenomenal, always keeping us in the loop, not hiding anything and being truthful. I really do enjoy working for one of the UKs best housebuilders",.. .. .. .. ..

It stops at that!,"I worked at KPMG GDC for about 9 months. Being straight out of college, I really did look forward to see how I can grow in the audit space. After about 2 weeks of very intense training, we we're finally able to be a part of respective teams on ""The Floor"". As fancy as that sounds, ""The Floor"" was something I began to dread in a few months.

I did have a wonderful work buddy that was super supportive, guiding me every step of the way. But that in no way compensated for everything else. I belonged to a team that did not speak any English, and primarily stuck to their own local vernacular. The irony is that the HR team instructs you to speak in English on the day you join.

Then comes the ""Busy Season"". Employees work for a minimum of 12 hours without any overtime pay and it really does take a toll on you- physically, mentally and emotionally. Might I remind you, the so called busy season happens at the end of every quarter which technically adds up to 6 months a year of working a 12 hour shift.

The Director goes around telling everyone that we are ""Auditors"". The truth is, we're not auditing; we're just doing the dirty backend work that actual auditors in the US don't have time to do.

I changed teams 3 times in 9 months, which I thought was ok because I got to meet and interact with different folks across the office. I happened to be in a team with a manager who didn't let us talk, always complained when we went for a quick coffee break, and never found a reason to life his team up. I soon realised flattering your managers would ensure you get recognised.

Let's talk about the HR team. A HR team is supposed to be supportive, that was never the case! I realised that once I joined, they didn't really give their new hires a second thought, and in my opinion, that's just bad employee experience. Even on my last day, they were so cold about my exit formalities, and made me follow up several times. I mean, I don't blame them; I'm pretty sure it's an everyday story.

Did I forget to mention that employees are grossly underpaid for the work they are made to perform.

Here's where you're probably wondering - it was the start of my career, of course you'll be made to work like crazy. But KPMG, you really outdid yourselves on the overworking your employees piece. I remember an employee being recognised because he stayed the night in office to complete a work paper! That's what you expect employees to do in order to get recognised.

Perhaps it's the industry, perhaps I wasn't cut out for audit, but it's important for you to be ethical. Treat your employees well, they too are your key stakeholders in the company along with your engagement teams across the globe. Why don't you adopt an ""employee comes first"" methodology? Believe me when I say it'll work wonders to the dynamic you have going now. Team HR,  get off your high horses and look to understand what your employees are going through. I think the attrition rate speaks for itself though. Doesn't that data tell you that there's something KPMG is doing that clearly isn't right?!

Having a fancy new office is in no way going to compensate for all the other aspects of the work you got going."

I have worked at SAP for 8 years (including my student internship) and I have almost only met helpful and nice people both in Germany and the US. Even with senior executives the experience were mostly good. 

The company has given me the opportunity to work in the US straight out of university for which I will be always grateful. I have had great mentors and am very lucky to be where I am in my career.  

SAP is financially generous to its employees and allows for a fantastic work-life balance both on campus with health options (gym, running track), free food and access to the latest gadgets. Also off-campus, the company allows to work from home when needed to enable the employee to attend to personal matters as long as the job is getting done.","It is somewhat hard to explore new opportunities within the company if you're not working in a hub location like Walldorf, Palo Alto or Newtown Square. That is not a fault of SAP but just a systemic problem of satellite locations.

2. Corporate events were fun
3. Work experience is valuable, but there is a limit. You will not gain more after 3 years, anything after is not transferable in any other career.","1. Low salary for high hours. Salaries consistently dropped over the years across the Greater Toronto Area while inflation rises.
2. Employee benefits are phased out (spun in a way that they are being improved to employees)
3. Performance favors long hour workers (70-120 weekly hours)
4. You cannot advance outside accounting or tax because you are provoked to work all of your free time. Sabbaticals and leave of absences are almost never approved, only granted to partners. You are expected to work just as many hours even when you have a Reduced workload in contract.
5.  Limited transfer opportunities - Management team (in a unit) have an incentive to keep you in their group. A transfer is the same as you quitting. 
6. Limited opportunities within Public accounting, as mid size firms  require a broader spectrum of talent which the big four have disaggregated out to other functions. In industry, there is a breadth of skills that are not earned in the big four.
7. Partners are tied to a budget to meet their own salary/profitability goals. This is why there is never 'enough' staff and why employees have to work more than the worth of 2 individuals at any given time.
8. You will never enjoy the full scale of your benefit package as management has a right to not approve it to their benefit if it hurts their internal budget (which it always will). 
9. KPMG has a high percent of breaches in audit practices. Management causes this by reducing engagement hours to low numbers to meet partners incentives which breaches auditor objectivity and independence in a sector that is supposed to add confidence to the financial markets.  
10, The respect and knowledge a CPA had earned is often not performed in this firm due to their limitations imposed by management. Partners are scared to lose their clients and will do anything including breach independence and objectivity to keep them.
11.  Direct exposure in observing those at KPMG lie directly to government agencies.
12. Empty promises, numerous experiences having group agreed upon complaints brought to partners attention. As turnover is 80% and partners see employees as a number/statistic, there is no adjustment and often the group of employees wash out."

The inner departments still have tedious manual processes that are not effective as they should be. If looking into the payroll position. Be clear it is in-house payroll in its most manual form. They only use their payroll system at maybe 60% of its capability. Everyone on the team has their own function and unfortunately they do not have they man power or teamwork abilities to help you if you need assistance with your particular job function. Training is inadequate; unless you are already familiar with their payroll system good luck. Long hours and work/life balance non- existent. Manager was very unyielding and new at her position. Lots of opportunities to make the team more functional but nothing was beneficial for the teammates on lower levels.

Pinpoint. Being managed on a system that is flawed and doesn't have all the deals that are available to us on the old systems.
PIE, the till system. Looks like teletext, behaves like teletext, we work in a technology industry so why are we still using a system from the early 80's
Targets inflated and footfall not taken into account, seems like someone sits in an office and plucks a number out of the air.
Geek squad. Legally we cannot be managed on this yet the company expects us to sell overpriced insurance to 50% of out contract customers and we still get managed on this as a KPI, enter the dodgy sales people...explained below.
RGM'S having different focuses to store BM'S, this is clearly noticeable when the priority changes in an instant and we are threatened with performance management for something we didn't know was being so heavily pushed.
Daily conference calls to discuss the figures sent out in an email, these calls are held during store opening times removing the manager from the sales floor. Constant bombardment of text messages and whatsapp messages from management during the day. Also being ridiculed and bullied for a poor day or asking about an issue you didn't know how to fix.
Mystery shop criteria constantly being changed and stores not briefed about changes until the month after so impossible to hit. Part if the mystery shop is our magic moments which are a set of quotes that need to be said to pass the mystery shop however they are not natural and all members of staff feel uncomfortable saying and also extras need to be offered as part if the mystery shop even though the ""customer"" has not decided on a device.
No progression opportunities as we have ""designate"" managers who are floating managers and these will fill any BM vacancies immediately rather than progressing the hard working employees in the store. 
Whistle blowing process not worth the time of day. Personally have submitted several whistle blowing forms about managers who actively push their teams to sell insurance and accessories to customer using discounts and chashback without advising the customer and telling them the insurance is free, legally insurance cannot be free, this is regulated by the FCA however nothing ever comes about from it no matter how many times it is highlighted to senior management.
Our online sister company's eg e2save send all their issues into store so we get hit with returns so have to work doubly hard to achieve our exaggerated targets. These returns do get removed but not for 3 months so we get penalised for the return by management during our monthly reviews.
Overall the people who do the job correctly are being managed out of the business yet the people pushing dodgy sales are the ones being praised and rewarded."

I saw many agents who could have cared less about the customer and would enroll everyone into the same plan.  Some agents wouldn't take the time to do drug plans for the customer but yet those agents were making the most money.  So the agents who treated the customer the worst got the Team Lead positions, won awards, etc...  I spoke with many customers who would call back in due to the first agent not taking the time with them and rushing them.  When they called back (and Extend couldn't figure out why the call volume was high) then I would take my time to make sure they felt like they had enrolled into the correct plan.  The first year I was with Extend they told us to enroll every one into a Medigap F plan.  Extend would get higher commission.  Then the next year they told us to put people into a plan that fit their needs, but to do a drug plan took a long time and some agents wouldn't do them.  This made the customer have to call back in and then the agents that did take their time with the customer got docked for long phone time.  The first year we made a base pay plus some commission.  The 2nd year we were told it was against the law to pay us commission.  Really?  Since when is it against the law to pay insurance agents a commission?  They make millions during the AEP and then they lay off the agents.  The disgusting part of their process is they make the seasonal agent sign a non-compete agreement which says they can't sell health insurance anywhere else.  Is this fair?  They use the employee, toss them out and then don't let them work anywhere else as a health agent.  Talk about one sided.  Employment at it's worst.  They are smiling all the way to the bank while the employees get used and abused.  They don't know what it is to take care of customers or employees."

The modernization aspects and ability to innovate, growing the business through entrepreneurial ideals, are very attractive qualities of this organization. I've always found my team to be approachable, open, and available to provide feedback. The projects are challenging and allow for growth opportunities at all levels. I feel proud to tell people where I work and I'm confident in the growth strategies of the firm. Leadership knows where we provide the most value and target the right companies at the right time. 

While the firm isn't the most diverse, you can actively see the strides and efforts that the organization is making to grow and develop in this area.","It seems to be a trend in most companies, to introduce a major perk for working at the company and then introduce so many hoops to jump through to take advantage of that perk. Sames goes for GT and their flexible time off policy. This is supposed to be a major benefit but there was the introduction of so many extra approval steps that it just ends up being a headache. 

Also, the introduction of external hires at the partner level, who's beliefs and actions aren't congruent with GT's cultural values, threatens the balance of culture that the organization has worked so hard to implement. 

The constant restructuring of the firm reduces overall employee engagement and belief in these changes. Every time this happens, employees lose faith and confidence in their organization's strategies. Also, the politics that happen through those restructuring strategies create division and confusion among the departments."

It is a competitive, soulless, brural place.   To survive there you have to focus only on yourself and nobody else.  Win at all costs.   As a so called Partner which is the over inflated name they give to what are essentially engagement directors with quotas, you will have a sales quota of between 10 and 20m typically, called a signings target.  You will also have a revenue target which requires you to be actively delivering an engagement.   You will also be given a personal utilization target of at least 35% at a bill rate that is quite high and a profit target.   You will be rated based on a formula of how you achieved against those metrics depending on how they are weighing each component that year and that can and does change every year.   If you do not make that number and all elements of your quota, you will be rated a 3 and be fired at the end of the year unless you are lucky enough to be part of the boys club and then they will try to manipulate the numbers enough to make you a 2.  No commissions of any sort are paid and you may not get a bonus if there is no funding in the profit sharing regardless of your rating.  Last year it is was funded at 30%.  

Partners are ranked against each other in their work group and then folded into larger groups.  They are rated on  total dollar volume not percentage of attainment so if you do small deals and somebody sells things that are large deals, they will always be ranked higher.  

There are no real rules for territories.  Anybody can sell on someone else's patch and there is no shared credit. If someone does a deal in your territory and refuses to team with you, tough luck.  And if you are teaming you will have to divide up the deal among all the mouths to feed including the APs.  There is a shortage of qualified deals so people glom on.  There is this team shadow credit but it is a joke and doesn't keep you from being fired   Partners can cut out other partners by bringing in APs that have the domain knowledge.  APs love that.   APs have to do almost all the work on Rfps and there is almost no presales and/or presentation development support.  

There is no good system to forecast resource needs on a deal.  You have to fill out a tedious and outdated excel spreadsheet that is then sent to Costa Rica to be re entered   

Methodology is hit or miss and there is no good knowledge sharing portal for methodology.  What there is is pretty poor and not used.  Many PMs make up stuff as they go along.   There are legions of staff people that have big dog jobs supposedly maintaining and developing methodology and produce nothing of real value.   The reason projects fail is usually due to lack of resources and/or methodolgy.  Just ask customers. 

There is a shortage of consultants in many areas as staffing and hiring is not undertaken until a SOW is signed.  So on many occasions there is no way to execute and ramp up quickly.   Retention is actually fairly good considering unless it is resource action time but there are still staffing issues galore.  

There is no money for team meetings so you never get much chance to meet your colleagues and since you are pitted against them in the rating system that is probably better.    

Teamwork is non existent and nobody bothers to answer emails or calls.  That bad habit is rampant.  Many of the senior people are the worst offenders.  I worked for a woman who would not even make eye contact with me in an elevator once.  It was like I didn't exist.  She was my boss's boss.   She rarely answered any emails I sent and I only sent her things on rare occasions.  One other partner I worked with would never and I mean never answer emails from almost everyone. 

Travel is heavy and the expense policy is typical but frugal.  The expense report system is great and some of the best software they have.  They have big data analytics to monitor every cent.  You have no discretionary budget.  You are not allows to spend money on entertainment unless you are part of the boys club and they trust you to spend to close a deal but even then there are strictl limits. 

Most customers in this industry are men and it is very hard for women partners to succeed.  The track record is terrible and women are given no help or accommodation for the challenges of being a woman in a male dominated industry.  None.   They bring in women and Fire them as a regular course.  The very senior women are the type that got there a while ago when it was a fad to have women in senior roles  and they are competitive and vicious and are some of the least supportive of other women.  They tend to surround themselves with the boys club to have someone to do the work.  

I could go on and on but I think you get the picture   If you are willing to risk your career and are ok with being fired or reduced to nothing in a culture that devalues humans"

Having worked at another agency before Hays, I can confidently say that the training and support you will recieve here is first class and like no other in the industry. 
This can be a job for life if you work hard to achieve your targets and there are always plenty of new opportunities for you to follow if you want to learn something new, or take your career in a different direction. 
Overall, the people you will work with are awesome and one of the main reasons I have stayed with Hays for the last 8 years. You'll be surounded by experienced consultants and directors who will encourage you.
Now more than ever I am so grateful to work for an organisation like Hays, the support we have had through COVID-19 lockdown, moving to 100% remote working and more recently a hyrid approach, has been really impressive.","Previously the recruitment industry has had a reputation for long hours and not offering a very flexible working environment/ work life balance. I've been really impressed with how Hays has supported their employees and implemented a more flexible return to work/ hybrid working policy. All of my team and office have responded well to the more flexible approach to working and I hope it's here to stay.
The job can involved long hours (but that is the case in most recruitment jobs), high pressure and targets driven

You can stick to the company for years together if you dont want change. because the company's name is big, getting travel visas is very easy (LOL)","stagnancy is a major concern unless monotonous work schedule is your career. if you get stuck with a weak manager, appreciation/recognition is next to none. internal politics play a major role in career progress and you cannot change divisions if your manager wants you to get stuck or just leave. hikes, promotion and bonus are highly dependant on how much you like to kiss ass!!"

Money for raises are distributed to you manager, who then can allocate that amount to anybody, with or without merit. So sucking up to the boss is the only way to go.

Summary - its pure luck which team you join, stay away from any support teams as you will be expected to have numerous applications to support.

I believe that brokers are concerned about quantitative analysts potentially becoming brokers and are therefore ensuring that they are not involved in the business winning process as a self-preservation strategy. Lack of clarity around bonus, poor pay reviews and employment of a horrific bonus claw back schemes."

2.	If you are a professional software developer you better avoid this place, you have to be crazy to go work there. At some places people shoot emails late night and across weekends and try to meet fascist deadlines.
3.	It doesn't matter how good you are or whether you are right. Once you shown a mirror to your manager you will be always shown in a bad light. Objective difficulties to meet a deadline are not considered. It is always only your low performance is the root of all evils.
4.	If you work at outsourcing location you will be cut off from many things they do in London. You have to guess what they know or decided or already done. You better guess well otherwise you will be labeled incompetent and stupid. As soon as one knows something it is a weapon to present itself as a smart and competent. Don’t expect too much help from anyone.

I guess the fact that you can use the discount at their sister stores COS, Cheap Monday and And Other Stories is pretty good. Wouldn't bother spending the money at H+M though as everything is so poorly made. 
I was lucky enough to have some previous visual merchandising experience, which meant I was given the opportunity to help that team, but people without previous experience weren't offered the opportunity.","No consideration for part time workers. Given a 20 hour a week contract and told that I had to be fully flexible 7 days a week, which believe it or not makes it incredibly hard to find another job to make up the hours to make the money you need to live. On top of that, they pay minimum wage for the first 3 months, upping to a very generous (!) £6.50 per hour after you've passed your probation. 
I found that people were generally promoted dependent on how long they'd been there, which made for quite a weak management structure at the top and it showed. 

Lots of petty 'punishments' for till errors, which could very easily be solved by upgrading the tills. ie: a customer with 30 things comes up to the till, you scan everything through and then customer decides it's too much money and removes 7 items... You can't cancel those on the till, as any more than 5 error corrects in one transaction gets you a 'cashier error' (you will be called to the office, made to sign a sheet saying you acknowledge you've done a naughty, and be patronisingly talked through the correct process and given a stern warning) .
 You have to void the ENTIRE transaction and start again. Try explaining that to a customer with a screaming kid. (Hint: the 'it's policy' argument doesn't get you very far)

Not paying people for time spent clearing up at the end of shifts is unacceptable. I was once told that I was expected to 'give' at least 10-15 minutes at the end of every shift, unpaid. And that I had to be on the floor 5-10 minutes before a shift started too. If you need us there, pay us. Simple as. 
Also, the till systems are so antiquated it's a joke. And then you expect us to do a stocktake, when the till's don't scan things properly, and wonder why the results are so poor?

Management have their favourites and barely look at or speak to you unless you are in their clique.

EVERY SINGLE meeting you schedule will get rescheduled, many of them MULTIPLE TIMES.  Someone tell the Partners about the idea of respecting others time and honoring appointments --- the Partners constantly backing out are causing massive re-work and CHAOS out there.  Four dimensional calendars?  Come on, people.  How about this fun workplace practice:  Your supervisors will strategically plant themselves near the elevators at 4:55pm to make sure no one is leaving early.

This is a short term type job rather than a long term career choice.","If you work full time you will never have a life. Always working weekends and requesting time off is not always easy. The hotel discounts are good but finding an available hotel is very difficult (don't plan on staying anywhere on the weekend cause it wont happen), turnover is high with supervisors and they only care about the big picture which is expecting way too much from agents with each call. They also do not like if you have to take medical leave or maternity leave which resulted in a lot of people not coming back after taking leave. Your experience also depends on who you work under. Some supervisors are great and appreciative of what agents do, others barely give a ""good job"" when you meet all of their ridiculous expectations. Working from home is nice, however their virtual system is constantly having issues, calls get dropped, system freezes and requires you to reboot your entire computer, programs that we use do not work. Even though the issues are on their end they expect you to still be able to work through it, and if it happens enough time they will fire you without warning for having too many issues, even though the issues are on their end. Pay starts low and with yearly raises you would still have to remain with the company for a long time before making a reasonable wage. Full time employees get to bid on a schedule every 6 months but its based on seniority, which means if you've been with the company for less than 3 or 4 years then you'll most likely get a terrible schedule. Work/life balance is also awful and don't even think about getting to spend the holidays with family if they are out of town/state. Also if you ask 3 people the same question you will get 3 different answers. And the hotels are not on the same page as the call center so you get a lot of customers that were told conflicting pieces of information and finding the right answer takes forever....then you get penalized for that."

194738,Deloitte,2019-01-20, Senior Analyst,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Arlington, VA",2,2.0,4.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,v,r,x,Great benefits but are deceiving,"Great Benefits, lasting relationships with people that can be friends, can be easy to do task that does not look at your education, has training opportunities","Overworked, low bonuses, hard to transfer to other offices, hard to transfer to work worldwide, too much red tape, training opportunities ONLY favor certain line of individuals, too much politics, so many to name. Here is my long story:

I started at Deloitte as a Associate level now known as Project Delivery. I had about five interviews in one day and I highly prepared for it, but it was nothing like a case study it was more like a typical interview; strength, weaknesses, why should we pick you and etc. Later I was talking with a PPD about my salary and what I should earn. I negotiated as best as I could but had no other offers, so I was low balled. I was hired and satisfied. 

Coming orientation day; they gave me the wrong address and I ended being late. Really nice :-/. Anyways I was lucky to be staffed as many people were just entering the firm with no project. The orientation promised all these things such as training opportunities, Deloitte University, be able to travel, be able to move to other offices, and be able to work worldwide. While yes these are all true it's ONLY for some. Everyone does not get these opportunities. I only found out later that these were just ways to make people ""excited."" 

My first project was a nightmare; management treated me like total garbage. Between the words I was worthless, not learning any skills and I would fail. They actually set me up for failure. When I finally was told to roll off I had to go to ethics as they told other projects not to hire me because my counselor at that time was best friends with the PM. It was really petty and disgusting that they wanted to ruin my career. I fought back hard and won and I was able to find a project more comfortably. I would say it was a long fight and prepare to be stressed if this ever happens. I had to talk to several offices, people, and had many countless nights of no sleep because I really thought my world was crashing down. I found out later the PM an assistant manager was having relations in the office late at night and during the day as someone I knew caught them in the act. One of the managers still works at Deloitte today which I find very troubling. 

Finally another project hired me and I am still with them. They can be a great set of people but so many manager shifts that it makes it tiring at times. Sometimes management just makes excuses to not let you obtain your goals and tons of red tape. 

Associates became project delivery analysts and I have been stuck at this service line since I been hired. I been wanting to move out but there are so many rules and regulations that I always get rejected or hear another excuses. Project delivery people cant go to Deloitte University because we have to be 100% client deliverable; we do not get bench time either. Yes its a very predictable schedule but very hard to grow as a person. They want you to stay at your same role for long periods of time and they do not really like you to even move around lie consultants or specialists are allowed. 

My last opportunity was a disaster as new people were hired and took this project I wanted to join. This would have been my way to switch tracks but of course Deloitte gave them funding and I was left in the dirt. Its unfortunate that people like this get to move up while throwing others under the bus. 

Overall: It has great benefits and training opportunities but only for some. Others will not be able to grow and management can actually be helpful at times but Deloitte is filled with so much red tape it's discouraging. I feel at my age (which I am in my 30's) that I am stuck and do not know my next move sadly."

Strong safety culture, especially in Manufacturing.","Difficult place to be in many ways. 
Parking - difficult 
Getting a desk to sit at comfortably for the day - difficult. 
Getting stuff done and delivered - difficult (if you’re prepared to fight every day for progress then you will eventually make change happen).
Giving feedback - difficult (folks are very nice to each other but lack the bottle to have difficult conversations).

Total compensation is not competitive - bonus payments have poor in recent years due to unachievable and ego led targets (yet the CEO will still take home a hefty sum).

Workplace standards are still very poor in some locations. There is no glamour working in this industry, the gloss of the product is not reflected in working environment. 

Some key teams and functions lack experienced leaders leading to poor decisions and chaos. 

Progression and promotion will be down to a ‘face fits’ approach rather than fairness and transparency. 

Production and product will always come before humans (unless serious harm is likely). Some basic human needs are often not met and production associates are treated poorly. 

Worst of all, the product is poor quality. It looks great but it is pot luck if a customer managers to go 12 months without a breakdown call out or a trip to the dealership.

However that's about it. It really depends on which office you working at as some offices have horrible management which makes it even harder to come to work each morning.","Management is not supportive, would never help with anything, most of the time even demotivates you. But there are also very few people who can help but rare to find them.
In most of offices there are zero career opportunities so not many people last more than a year. 
It's all about visibility and with whom you are a friend and who likable you are. Most of the manager don't do more than just have meeting which no one knows what they are about or spend the day on Facebook at work.
There's lack of communication across the company, not many people know what they are doing including management. 
I believe there are much worse jobs out there, however I would definitely think twice. Few years ago this was a nice place to work, but with all the cost cuts, huge staff turnover and management it became a place where not many people want to be. 
Be prepared to spend 8h per day on the phone arguing with people who cannot read, unless you are on a language line which is closed and receives only emails. If you are looking for a job and need money go for it, but if you looking for a career or want to progress than rather choose something else as that's not going to happen unless you applying in the head office."

Your just a number added to there 66000 other employees.
A lot of team managers are shockingly bad and care little about the client/customer and only on targets. Which is poor because Capita is an outsourcing business and supposed to treat the clients customers as if there own.  Instead they ignore compliance concerns and possible complaints in favour of what is least amount of cost to Capita.  Irrespective if it was Capita that created the compliance issue it is put under a carpet and ignored.  If you raise an issue as you are told to by senior management your TM takes a dislike to you for highlighting the issue and so he has to actually do some work.

If you have ideas they are ignored, even if they are really great and can save both employer and client money.  Team managers do not like those below them outshining them. 

Daily constant IT issues.

Half yearly 121s are a joke with ratings from Team managers based on perception and not facts.

Not for free thinkers or those who want to do well and want a challenge.  If you have a moral compass then avoid Capita

Overall the senior management show good empathy and seem to care about the core values, the issue is that team managers do not follow in the same way as the message we get from higher up.  Instead doing as little as possible with minimal effort."

Parts of IBM are growing revenue and parts of IBM are losing revenue.  In recent years, this has led to yearly 'resource actions' where large numbers of employees are laid off in the parts of IBM that are losing revenue.  My experience is that IBMers struggle with work-life balance.  If you are in the part of IBM that is growing the team is always understaffed so everyone is working OT just to keep up.  If you are in the part of IBM that is losing revenue, headcount is cut so deep the few remaining headcount are doing the work of multiple people or constantly training off shore resources that seem to turn over quickly."

I guess no Asians, Indians, African Americans, or  Hispanics are interested in working in real estate. When they hire 1 per 100, they are left to feel uncomfortable. A lady in property management always referred to African Americans as ""they"",  and how she doesn't like driving in ""their"" neighborhoods.  She said ""they"" are always killing each other and doesn't want to get caught in the middle of it. You know, appropriate office conversations. She also always touched an African American girl's hair. She doesn't even ask, making the poor girl from a local high school feel very uncomfortable.  You don't touch African American people's hair! it is a real estate company,  not a salon."

This makes for a really creative environment, where everyone is pushing you to go beyond your limits and make something even better.  It also means that you can just trust that everyone around you is really good at what they do.

There's also a huge focus on only launching things when they're ready, which, as an engineer, means when something does launch, you're really proud of it, and don't feel like it's half-assed because you were rushing to a deadline and cut a lot of corners.

Oh, and the free food and benefits rock, but they wouldn't keep me at any job if I didn't enjoy the work and the people.  But when you do like the job and the people, they make it that much better:)","Google is getting big.  This means a couple things: It's no longer always a ""startup"" feel.  There's a lot of teams, and a lot of infrastructure, and there's starting to be a bit of bureaucracy here and there (though management has done a pretty good job killing it on sight whenever they see it).

Also, because we have a lot of users and are always in the limelight, we have to be really careful about launching things, which often means that launching something requires jumping through more hoops to make sure it's scalable and stable, and that all the i's are dotted and t's are crossed, in order to not have a bad press situation or an emergency caused by an overloaded system.  This is good for production launches, but can slow down experimentation in the early stages of a product."
